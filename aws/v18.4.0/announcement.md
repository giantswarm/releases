**Workload cluster release v18.4.0 for AWS is available**. This release contains changes that address several vulnerabilities and overall improvements. We extended the IRSA trust policy for external-dns IAM role so it can be used by multiple external-dns in your workload clusters. This release also adds new component `cilium-prerequisites` to help with the Cilium migration. Please check [IAM permissions requirements](https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm-aws-account-prerequisites/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#310---2023-04-27) for this release. Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/workload-cluster-releases-aws/releases/aws-v18.4.0/).

> **_Info:_** Cilium support that was introduced in 18.0.0 was rolled back to AWS CNI because of an unresolved upstream bug. Cilium support is postponed to version v19.0.0.

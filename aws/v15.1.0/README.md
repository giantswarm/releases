## Change details


### kubernetes [1.20.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.20.9)

#### Feature
- Kubernetes 1.20.x is now built using Go 1.15.14 ([#103677](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103677), [@puerco](https://github.com/puerco)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Instrumentation, Release and Testing]
- Updates the following images to pick up CVE fixes:
  - `debian` to v1.8.0

#### Bug or Regression
- Fix scoring for NodeResourcesMostAllocated and NodeResourcesBalancedAllocation plugins when nodes have containers with no requests. This was leaving to under-utilization of small nodes.

- VSphere: Fix regression during attach disk if datastore is within a storage folder or datastore cluster. ([#102999](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102999), [@gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied)) [SIG Cloud Provider]

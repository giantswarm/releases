# :zap: Giant Swarm Release v19.0.0 for AWS :zap:

> **WARNING:** Please talk to your Account Engineer prior to upgrading. You will be provided with a checklist to follow and validate your clusters.

This release includes upgrades of components and Kubernetes version to 1.24. The upgrade to `v19.0.0` involve two major changes for customers, namely the migration from the AWS VPC CNI to Cilium and the replacement of Kiam with IAM Roles for Service Accounts(IRSA) for authenticating pods against the AWS API.
Next sections are describing important changes we will introduce with the new release, the key benefits, what customers can do to prepare and how to avoid downtime during this crucial upgrade. 

***IAM Permissions Requirements***
The minimal requirement for the IAM permissions is [Version 3.3.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm-aws-account-prerequisites/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#330---2023-05-11) of [giantswarm-aws-account-prerequisites](https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm-aws-account-prerequisites/) repository.

## Cilium

Say goodbye to slow network initialization times and hello to lightning-fast performance with [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium), our new Kubernetes CNI solution!

### Key Highlights

- Service Mesh integration: `Cilium` is designed to work seamlessly with popular service meshes like `Istio`, `Linkerd`, and `Envoy`. This allows for more advanced networking and security features, such as mTLS encryption and observability.
- `Cilium` uses a virtual network which provides more flexibility, faster network initialization, and more advanced networking features compared to `AWS CNI` affecting the IP addresses.
- Advanced networking features: `Cilium` supports advanced networking features such as load balancing, network segmentation, and eBPF-based packet filtering. These features allow for more granular control over network traffic and improve security. 
- Scalability: `Cilium's` eBPF-based data plane is highly scalable and performs well even at scale. It is also highly efficient, reducing overhead and maximizing performance.
- Improvements in pods time to come up due to cilium endpoint refresh substituting the kubeproxy refresh of iptables.
- More efficient usage of IP space - fully described in `Cilium and IP space` section below.

### What changes with Cilium?

With `Cilium`, you'll no longer be using the `AWS CNI` Pod subnets, so be sure to add custom routes with the `Node subnet(s) CIDR(s)` instead. 

Additionally, while `Cilium's Network Policy` provides powerful security features, support for setting `ipBlock` with `Pod IPs` is not implemented in Cilium, so be sure to inspect your workloads and configure `Network Policies` carefully. The Account Engineers will reach out to you and help to provide the `CiliumNetworkPolicies` before the upgrade in order to have no downtime during the switch. [Cilium-prerequisites](https://github.com/giantswarm/cilium-prerequisites) app that installs the `CiliumNetworkPolicy` CRD is available in the catalog as well as will be installed with GS version `v18.4.0` to provide seemless upgrade experience.

It's important to note that due to changes to `Cluster CR's` during the upgrade process, `GitOps` automation will have to be suspended and any applied changes backported to the repos before resuming. Keep this in mind as you prepare for the upgrade. This needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, since different GitOps implementations might only keep _some_ parts of `Cluster` CRs in Git. Feel free to reach out to your Account Engineer to understand more about these changes.

To ensure a smooth transition to `Cilium`, we've prepared a [comprehensive upgrade process](https://handbook.giantswarm.io/docs/support-and-ops/ops-recipes/upgrade-to-cilium/) that explains every migration step in detail, so you can feel confident in following the process and avoid any potential issues. We have also extended our [documentation](https://docs.giantswarm.io/platform-overview/cluster-management/vintage/aws/#pod-networking) which describes differences between `AWS CNI` and `Cilium`

#### Cilium and AWS Load Balancer Controller

If you are running `aws-load-balancer-controller` inside your clusters for managing [Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html) and you did set the annotation `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: ip`, you need to change it to `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-nlb-target-type: instance`.

For further information, please checkout the [documentation](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.2/guide/service/annotations/#traffic-routing)

#### Cilium and pod CIDR

While switching to Cilium we are forced to change the CIDR used to assign IPs to Pods (192.168.0.0/16 by default).
The process is automated for the vast majority of the clusters, but if you had set up custom networking settings in your cluster the upgrade might be blocked by admission controllers. If that is the case, reach out to your SA and you'll receive guidance how to move on with the upgrade. Same thing applies if you don't want to stick with the default value and prefer to change it.

#### Cilium and improved IP space usage

Migration from AWS CNI to Cilium allowed us to improve the IP space delegation per WC, meaning that starting with AWS v19 release customers will be able to use full range of the CIDR instead of 25%.

#### AWS-CNI in releases prior to v19

By default at Giant Swarm the pod CIDR is set to 10.2.0.0/16 and can be customized in the AWSCluster CR.
The CIDR is added in the VPC CIDR and thus cannot overlap with other CIDRs in the cluster and any other CIDR in peered VPCs.

The pod CIDR space needs to be split into separate, contiguous CIDR space, one for each AZ. Since Giant Swarm supports 3 AZs, we need to divide the range into 4 subranges. In the default scenario, we end up with 4 /18 blocks (16k addresses each). One of the /18 blocks is unused meaning we have 16k (or 1/4th) IP addresses "lost".

#### Cilium in releases v19 and further

In v19 and further releases the default pod CIDR is 192.168.0.0/16. The default can be changed by setting a field in the AWSCluster CR as it was the case so far.

*WARNING*: If pods need to talk directly with private IP addresses reachable through the VPC (for example peered resources) then those target private IP addresses must be on a separate IP space.

This CIDR is used across the whole cluster, regardless of AZs and all addresses from the range can be used. In the default setting, each node gets assigned a /25 subnet for pods running in it. Meaning we can have as many as 65k pods in a cluster (~ 595 nodes in theory) but that can be increased by providing a larger pod cidr space to begin with.

#### Maximum number of pods in a node

With AWS-CNI, IP addresses assigned to pods are actually IP addresses assigned to the node itself.
Depending on the instance type, there is a limit on the number of IP addresses assignable to each instance. This means in practice that clusters using AWS-CNI will have less pods per node in principle. With Cilium, we can use the max number of pods per node as [suggested by k8s](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large/) which is 110.

#### Cilium Troubleshooting
We have included a small [ops-recipe](https://handbook.giantswarm.io/docs/support-and-ops/ops-recipes/cilium-troubleshooting/) for details how you can start troubleshoot Cilium issues.

## IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)

By switching from `KIAM` to `IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)`, we're making it easier and more secure for your Kubernetes workloads to interact with AWS services. 

### Key Highlights

- Official AWS way to authenticate pods to AWS API.
- Reduced complexity: IRSA eliminates the need for a separate service like KIAM, streamlining your Kubernetes clusters.
- Regional STS (Security Token Service) rather than using global STS

### What changes with IRSA?

During the upgrade, we are removing `KIAM` as a default app in your workload clusters but it is possible to install it optionally. If you need to keep using KIAM in v19 clusters, please reach out to your SA.

Additionally, we are creating a `Cloudfront Domain Alias` (except China) for each cluster which is used as the [OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) to improve predictability and simplify IAM role creation. 

To ensure that your applications can assume the appropriate IAM roles, you need to add the `Cloudfront Domain Alias` to those roles as a [trust entity](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/iam-roles-for-service-accounts/#aws-release-v19).

We have also adjusted the `external-dns` IRSA trust policy to facilitate externalDNS role being assumed by any Service Account containing `external-dns` phrase to allow multiple app deployments.

To help make your transition to `IRSA` as easy as possible, we've added more context on our [official docs](https://docs.giantswarm.io/advanced/iam-roles-for-service-accounts/).

## Other release highlights

### ðŸŽ£ DNS Node Cache

To improve the DNS performance of your cluster [k8s-dns-node-cache-app](https://github.com/giantswarm/k8s-dns-node-cache-app) will be deployed by default.

#### Key Highlights

- Faster DNS lookups: The app caches DNS lookups on each node, reducing the time it takes to resolve domain names.
- Lower latency: By caching DNS requests locally on each node, the app reduces the need to query external DNS servers, which can improve latency.
- Reducing network traffic: By caching DNS responses locally on each node, the app reduces the need for repeated queries to external DNS servers, which can reduce network traffic.

If you previously deployed `k8s-dns-node-cache-app` through the managed catalog, you can delete the application after the upgrade, as it will be automatically re-installed.

### Prometheus Blackbox Exporter

The [prometheus-blackbox-exporter](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-blackbox-exporter-app) is a new monitoring component installed by default with release `v19`. 

#### Key Highlights

- Flexible monitoring: The blackbox exporter allows users to monitor endpoints from various protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP, ICMP, and more.
- Real-time monitoring: The exporter provides real-time monitoring of the endpoints and helps detect issues before they turn into major problems.
- Customizable checks: The blackbox exporter can be customized to perform specific checks on the endpoints, which helps in identifying problems quickly.
- Integration with Prometheus: The exporter integrates seamlessly with Prometheus, allowing users to visualize and analyze data collected from the endpoints.

We're aiming to provide a comprehensive blackbox monitoring tool that can validate internal, DNS and external connectivity.

### ðŸ”­ Cilium Hubble

`Cilium` will have [Hubble](https://github.com/cilium/hubble) enabled by default for troubleshooting and observability.

#### Key Highlights

- Provides real-time visibility into network traffic with advanced filtering and aggregation capabilities.
- Helps troubleshoot connectivity issues with its network flow and DNS query analysis features.

#### Caveats and know limitations

- Hubble's UI is not exposed by default, but can be reached using port forwarding. More information regarding the access in the [ops-recipe](https://handbook.giantswarm.io/docs/support-and-ops/ops-recipes/cilium-troubleshooting/#hubble-ui)

#### Major Themes

##### Dockershim Removed from kubelet

After its deprecation in v1.20, the dockershim component has been removed from the kubelet.
From v1.24 onwards, you will need to either use one of the other [supported runtimes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/) (such as containerd or CRI-O)
or use cri-dockerd if you are relying on Docker Engine as your container runtime.
For more information about ensuring your cluster is ready for this removal, please
see [this guide](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/03/31/ready-for-dockershim-removal/).

##### Beta APIs Off by Default

[New beta APIs will not be enabled in clusters by default](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3136).
Existing beta APIs and new versions of existing beta APIs, will continue to be enabled by default.

##### Signing Release Artifacts

Release artifacts are [signed](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031) using [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)
signatures
and there is experimental support for [verifying image signatures](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/verify-signed-images/).
Signing and verification of release artifacts is part of [increasing software supply chain security for the Kubernetes release process](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3027).

##### OpenAPI v3

Kubernetes 1.24 offers beta support for publishing its APIs in the [OpenAPI v3 format](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2896).

##### Storage Capacity and Volume Expansion Are Generally Available

[Storage capacity tracking](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1472)
supports exposing currently available storage capacity via [CSIStorageCapacity objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-capacity/#api)
and enhances scheduling of pods that use CSI volumes with late binding.

[Volume expansion](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/284) adds support
for resizing existing persistent volumes.

##### NonPreemptingPriority to Stable

This feature adds [a new option to PriorityClasses](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/902),
which can enable or disable pod preemption.

##### Storage Plugin Migration

There is work under way to [migrate the internals of in-tree storage plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/625) to call out to CSI Plugins,
while maintaining the original API.
The [Azure Disk](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1490)
and [OpenStack Cinder](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1489) plugins
have both been migrated.

##### gRPC Probes Graduate to Beta

With Kubernetes 1.24, the [gRPC probes functionality](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2727)
has entered beta and is available by default. You can now [configure startup, liveness, and readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#configure-probes) for your gRPC app
natively within Kubernetes, without exposing an HTTP endpoint or
using an extra executable.

##### Kubelet Credential Provider Graduates to Beta

Originally released as Alpha in Kubernetes 1.20, the kubelet's support for
[image credential providers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/kubelet-credential-provider/kubelet-credential-provider/)
has now graduated to Beta.
This allows the kubelet to dynamically retrieve credentials for a container image registry
using exec plugins, rather than storing credentials on the node's filesystem.

##### Contextual Logging in Alpha

Kubernetes 1.24 has introduced [contextual logging](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3077)
that enables the caller of a function to control all aspects of logging (output formatting, verbosity, additional values and names).

##### Avoiding Collisions in IP allocation to Services

Kubernetes 1.24 introduced a new opt-in feature that allows you to
[soft-reserve a range for static IP address assignments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#service-ip-static-sub-range)
to Services.
With the manual enablement of this feature, the cluster will prefer automatic assignment from
the pool of Service IP addresses thereby reducing the risk of collision.

A Service `ClusterIP` can be assigned:

* dynamically, which means the cluster will automatically pick a free IP within the configured Service IP range.
* statically, which means the user will set one IP within the configured Service IP range.

Service `ClusterIP` are unique, hence, trying to create a Service with a `ClusterIP` that has already been allocated will return an error.

#### Urgent Upgrade Notes

##### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Docker runtime support using dockershim in the kubelet is now completely removed in 1.24. The kubelet used to have a module called dockershim, which implements CRI support for Docker, and it has seen maintenance issues in the Kubernetes community. From 1.24 onwards, please move to a container runtime that is a full-fledged implementation of CRI (v1alpha1 or v1 compliant) as they become available. ([#97252](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/97252), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))
- Fixed bug with leads to Node goes `Not-ready` state when credentials for vCenter stored in a secret and Zones feature is in use. Zone labels setup moved to KCM component, kubelet skips this step during startup in such case. If credentials stored in cloud-provider config file as plaintext current behaviour does not change and no action required. For proper functioning `kube-system:vsphere-legacy-cloud-provider` should be allowed to update node object if vCenter credentials stored in secret and Zone feature used. ([#101028](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101028), [@lobziik](https://github.com/lobziik))
- The `LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate is beta, and enabled by default. When enabled, Secret API objects containing service account tokens are no longer auto-generated for every ServiceAccount. Use the [TokenRequest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/token-request-v1/) API to acquire service account tokens, or if a non-expiring token is required, create a Secret API object for the token controller to populate with a service account token by following this [guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#service-account-token-secrets). ([#108309](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108309), [@zshihang](https://github.com/zshihang))
- The calculations for Pod topology spread skew now exclude nodes that
  don't match the node affinity/selector. This may lead to unschedulable pods if you previously had pods
  matching the spreading selector on those excluded nodes (not matching the node affinity/selector),
  especially when the `topologyKey` is not node-level. Revisit the node affinity and/or pod selector in the
  topology spread constraints to avoid this scenario. ([#107009](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107009), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet))
- Remove the deprecated flag `--experimental-check-node-capabilities-before-mount`. With CSI now GA, there is a better alternative. Remove any use of  `--experimental-check-node-capabilities-before-mount` from your kubelet scripts or manifests. ([#104732](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104732), [@mengjiao-liu](https://github.com/mengjiao-liu))
- `kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release, possibly in 3 releases (one year). You should start using `kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3` for new clusters. To migrate your old configuration files on disk you can use the `kubeadm config migrate` command. ([#107013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107013), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
- Kubeadm: default the kubeadm configuration to the containerd socket (Unix: `unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock`, Windows: `npipe:////./pipe/containerd-containerd`) instead of the one for Docker. If the `Init|JoinConfiguration.nodeRegistration.criSocket` field is empty during cluster creation and multiple sockets are found on the host always throw an error and ask the user to specify which one to use by setting the value in the field. Make sure you update any kubeadm configuration files on disk, to not include the dockershim socket unless you are still using kubelet version < 1.24 with kubeadm >= 1.24. Remove the DockerValidor and ServiceCheck for the `docker` service from kubeadm preflight. Docker is no longer special cased during host validation and ideally this task should be done in the now external cri-dockerd project where the importance of the compatibility matters. Use `crictl` for all communication with CRI sockets for actions like pulling images and obtaining a list of running containers instead of using the docker CLI in the case of Docker. ([#107317](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107317), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- The feature gate was mentioned as `csiMigrationRBD` where it should have been `CSIMigrationRBD` to be in parity with other migration plugins. This release correct the same and keep it as `CSIMigrationRBD`.
    users who have configured this feature gate as `csiMigrationRBD` has to reconfigure the same to `CSIMigrationRBD` from this release. ([#107554](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107554), [@humblec](https://github.com/humblec))
- The experimental dynamic log sanitization feature has been deprecated and removed in the 1.24 release. The feature is no longer available for use. ([#107207](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107207), [@ehashman](https://github.com/ehashman))
- Kubeadm: apply `second stage` of the plan to migrate kubeadm away from the usage of the word `master` in labels and taints. For new clusters, the label `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` will no longer be added to control plane nodes, only the label `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane` will be added. For clusters that are being upgraded to 1.24 with `kubeadm upgrade apply`, the command will remove the label `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` from existing control plane nodes. For new clusters, both the old taint `node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule` and new taint `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule` will be added to control plane nodes. In release 1.20 (`first stage`), a release note instructed to preemptively tolerate the new taint. For clusters that are being upgraded to 1.24 with `kubeadm upgrade apply`, the command will add the new taint `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule` to existing control plane nodes. Please adapt your infrastructure to these changes. In 1.25 the old taint `node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule` will be removed. ([#107533](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107533), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))

#### Changes by Kind

##### Deprecation

- Deprecated `Service.Spec.LoadBalancerIP`. This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations.  As of Kubernetes v1.24, users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations when available.  This field may be removed in a future API version. ([#107235](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107235), [@uablrek](https://github.com/uablrek))
- Kube-apiserver: the `--master-count` flag and `--endpoint-reconciler-type=master-count` reconciler are deprecated in favor of the lease reconciler ([#108062](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108062), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Kube-apiserver: the insecure address flags `--address`, `--insecure-bind-address`, `--port` and `--insecure-port` (inert since 1.20) are removed ([#106859](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106859), [@knight42](https://github.com/knight42))
- Kubeadm: graduated the `UnversionedKubeletConfigMap` feature gate to Beta and enabled the feature by default. This implies that 1) for new clusters kubeadm will start using the `kube-system/kubelet-config` naming scheme for the kubelet ConfigMap and RBAC rules, instead of the legacy `kubelet-config-x.yy` naming. 2) during upgrade, kubeadm will only write the new scheme ConfigMap and RBAC objects. To disable the feature you can pass `UnversionedKubeletConfigMap: false` in the kubeadm config for new clusters. For upgrade on existing clusters you can also override the behavior by patching the ClusterConfiguration object in `kube-system/kubeadm-config`. More details in the associated KEP.

- The in-tree Azure plugin has been deprecated. The Azure kubelogin plugin serves as an out-of-tree replacement via the kubectl/client-go credential plugin mechanism.  Users will now see a warning in the logs regarding this deprecation. ([#107904](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107904), [@sabbey37](https://github.com/sabbey37))

##### API Change

- Kubernetes 1.24 is now built with go1.19.4 ([#113956](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/113956), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG Apps, Architecture, Auth, Autoscaling, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scheduling, Storage and Testing]
- Protobuf serialization of metav1.MicroTime timestamps (used in `Lease` and `Event` API objects) has been corrected to truncate to microsecond precision, to match the documented behavior and JSON/YAML serialization. Any existing persisted data is truncated to microsecond when read from etcd. ([#111936](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111936), [@haoruan](https://github.com/haoruan)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Revert regression that prevented client-go latency metrics to be reported with a template URL to avoid label cardinality. ([#112056](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/112056), [@aanm](https://github.com/aanm)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Add 2 new options for kube-proxy running in winkernel mode. `--forward-healthcheck-vip`, if specified as true, health check traffic whose destination is service VIP will be forwarded to kube-proxy's healthcheck service. `--root-hnsendpoint-name` specifies the name of the hns endpoint for the root network namespace. This option enables the pass-through load balancers like Google's GCLB to correctly health check the backend services. Without this change, the health check packets is dropped, and Windows node will be considered to be unhealthy by those load balancers. ([#99287](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99287), [@anfernee](https://github.com/anfernee))
- Added CEL runtime cost calculation into CustomerResource validation. CustomerResource validation will fail if runtime cost exceeds the budget. ([#108482](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108482), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37))

([#95400](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95400), [@tssurya](https://github.com/tssurya))
- CEL CRD validation expressions may now reference existing object state using the identifier `oldSelf`. ([#108073](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108073), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy))
- CRD deep copies should no longer contain shallow copies of `JSONSchemaProps.XValidations`. ([#107956](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107956), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy))
- CRD writes will generate validation errors if a CEL validation rule references the identifier `oldSelf` on a part of the schema that does not support it. ([#108013](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108013), [@benluddy](https://github.com/benluddy))
- CSIStorageCapacity.storage.k8s.io: The v1beta1 version of this API is deprecated in favor of v1, and will be removed in v1.27. If a CSI driver supports storage capacity tracking, then it must get deployed with a release of external-provisioner that supports the v1 API. ([#108445](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108445), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Custom resource requests with `fieldValidation=Strict` consistently require `apiVersion` and `kind`, matching non-strict requests ([#109019](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109019), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

- Fixes a regression in v1beta1 PodDisruptionBudget handling of `strategic merge patch`-type API requests for the `selector` field. Prior to 1.21, these requests would merge `matchLabels` content and replace `matchExpressions` content. In 1.21, patch requests touching the `selector` field started replacing the entire selector. This is consistent with server-side apply and the v1 PodDisruptionBudget behavior, but should not have been changed for v1beta1. ([#108138](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108138), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

- MaxUnavailable for StatefulSets, allows faster RollingUpdate by taking down more than 1 pod at a time. The number of pods you want to take down during a RollingUpdate is configurable using maxUnavailable parameter. ([#82162](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82162), [@krmayankk](https://github.com/krmayankk))
- Non-graceful node shutdown handling is enabled for stateful workload failovers ([#108486](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108486), [@sonasingh46](https://github.com/sonasingh46))
- Omit enum declarations from the static openapi file captured at https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/api/openapi-spec. This file is used to generate API clients, and use of enums in those generated clients (rather than strings) can break forward compatibility with additional future values in those fields. See https://issue.k8s.io/109177 for details. ([#109178](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109178), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))

- Kubelet TCP and HTTP probes are more effective using networking resources: conntrack entries, sockets, ... 
  This is achieved by reducing the TIME-WAIT state of the connection to 1 second, instead of the defaults 60 seconds. This allows kubelet to free the socket, and free conntrack entry and ephemeral port associated. ([#115143](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/115143), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Network and Node]

- CEL regex patterns in x-kubernetes-valiation rules are compiled when CRDs are created/updated if the pattern is provided as a string constant in the expression. Any regex compile errors are reported as a CRD create/update validation error. ([#108617](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108617), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz))
- CRD `x-kubernetes-validations` rules now support the CEL functions: `isSorted`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`, `find` and `findAll`. ([#108312](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108312), [@jpbetz](https://github.com/jpbetz))
- Changes the kubectl `--validate` flag from a bool to a string that accepts the values {true, strict, warn, false, ignore}
  - true/strict - perform validation and error the request on any invalid fields in the ojbect. It will attempt to perform server-side validation if it is enabled on the apiserver, otherwise it will fall back to client-side validation.
  - warn - perform server-side validation and warn on any invalid fields (but ultimately let the request succeed by dropping any invalid fields from the object). If validation is not available on the server, perform no validation.
  - false/ignore - perform no validation, silently dropping invalid fields from the object. ([#108350](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108350), [@kevindelgado](https://github.com/kevindelgado))
- Client-go metrics: change bucket distribution for `rest_client_request_duration_seconds` and `rest_client_rate_limiter_duration_seconds` from [0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.016, 0.032, 0.064, 0.128, 0.256, 0.512] to [0.005, 0.025, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 15.0, 30.0, 60.0}] ([#106911](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106911), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))

- Kubeadm: improve the strict parsing of user YAML/JSON configuration files. Next to printing warnings for unknown and duplicate fields (current state), also print warnings for fields with incorrect case sensitivity - e.g. `controlPlaneEndpoint` (valid), `ControlPlaneEndpoint` (invalid). Instead of only printing warnings during `init` and `join` also print warnings when downloading the ClusterConfiguration, KubeletConfiguration or KubeProxyConfiguration objects from the cluster. This can be useful if the user has patched these objects in their respective ConfigMaps with mistakes. ([#107725](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107725), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))

- Kubernetes 1.24 bumped version of golang it is compiled with to go1.18, which introduced significant changes to its garbage collection algorithm. As a result, we observed an increase in memory usage for kube-apiserver in larger an heavily loaded clusters up to ~25% (with the benefit of API call latencies drop by up to 10x on 99th percentiles). If the memory increase is not acceptable for you you can mitigate by setting GOGC env variable (for our tests using GOGC=63 brings memory usage back to original value, although the exact value may depend on usage patterns on your cluster). ([#108870](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108870), [@dims](https://github.com/dims))
- Kubernetes 1.24 is built with go1.18, which will no longer validate certificates signed with a SHA-1 hash algorithm by default. See https://golang.org/doc/go1.18#sha1 for more details.

- The `v1` version of `LeaderMigrationConfiguration` supports only `leases` API for leader election. To use formerly supported mechanisms, please continue using `v1beta1`. ([#108016](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108016), [@jiahuif](https://github.com/jiahuif))
- The kubelet now creates an iptables chain named `KUBE-IPTABLES-HINT` in
  the `mangle` table. Containerized components that need to modify iptables
  rules in the host network namespace can use the existence of this chain
  to more-reliably determine whether the system is using iptables-legacy or

- EndpointSlices marked for deletion are now ignored during reconciliation. ([#110484](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110484), [@aryan9600](https://github.com/aryan9600)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- Fixed a kubelet issue that could result in invalid pod status updates to be sent to the api-server where pods would be reported in a terminal phase but also report a ready condition of true in some cases. ([#110479](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110479), [@bobbypage](https://github.com/bobbypage)) [SIG Node and Testing]
- Pods will now post their readiness during termination. ([#110416](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110416), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG Network, Node and Testing]
- The pod phase lifecycle guarantees that terminal Pods, those whose states are Unready or Succeeded, can not regress and will have all container stopped. Hence, terminal Pods will never be reachable and should not publish their IP addresses on the Endpoints or EndpointSlices, independently of the Service TolerateUnready option. ([#110258](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/110258), [@robscott](https://github.com/robscott)) [SIG Apps, Network, Node and Testing]
- Fix JobTrackingWithFinalizers that:
  - was declaring a job finished before counting all the created pods in the status
  - was leaving pods with finalizers, blocking pod and job deletions
  
  JobTrackingWithFinalizers is still disabled by default. ([#109486](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109486), [@alculquicondor](https://github.com/alculquicondor)) [SIG Apps and Testing]
- Kubeadm: only taint control plane nodes when the legacy "master" taint is present. This avoids a bug where "kubeadm upgrade" will re-taint a control plane node with the new "control plane" taint even if the user explicitly untainted the node. ([#109841](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109841), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]

- A static pod that is rapidly updated was failing to start until the Kubelet was restarted. ([#107900](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107900), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))
- Add one metrics(`kubelet_volume_stats_health_abnormal`) of volume health state to kubelet ([#108758](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108758), [@fengzixu](https://github.com/fengzixu))
- Added a new label `type` to `apiserver_flowcontrol_request_execution_seconds` metric - it has the following values: - 'regular': indicates that it is a non long running request - 'watch': indicates that it is a watch request. ([#105517](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105517), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem))
- Added a test to guarantee that conformance clusters require at least 2 untainted nodes. ([#106313](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106313), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Adds PV deletion protection finalizer only when PV reclaimPolicy is Delete for dynamically provisioned volumes. ([#109205](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109205), [@deepakkinni](https://github.com/deepakkinni))

- Alowed useful inclusion of `-args $prog_args` in KUBE_TEST_ARGS, when doing `make test-integration`. ([#107516](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107516), [@MikeSpreitzer](https://github.com/MikeSpreitzer))
- An inefficient lock in EndpointSlice controller metrics cache has been reworked. Network programming latency may be significantly reduced in certain scenarios, especially in clusters with a large number of Services. ([#107091](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107091), [@robscott](https://github.com/robscott))
- Apiserver will now reject connection attempts to `0.0.0.0/::` when handling a proxy subresource request. ([#107402](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107402), [@anguslees](https://github.com/anguslees))

- Bump `sigs.k8s.io/apiserver-network-proxy/konnectivity-client@v0.0.30` to fix a goroutine leak in kube-apiserver when using egress selctor with the gRPC mode. ([#108437](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108437), [@andrewsykim](https://github.com/andrewsykim))
- CEL validation failure returns object type instead of object. ([#107090](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107090), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37))
- CRI-API: IPs returned by `PodSandboxNetworkStatus`` are ignored by the kubelet for host-network pods. ([#106715](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106715), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Call `NodeExpand` on all nodes in case of RWX volumes ([#108693](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108693), [@gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied))
- Changed node staging path for CSI driver to use a PV agnostic path. Nodes must be drained before updating the kubelet with this change. ([#107065](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107065), [@saikat-royc](https://github.com/saikat-royc))
- Client-go: fixed the paged list calls with `ResourceVersionMatch` set would fail once paging is kicked in. ([#107311](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107311), [@fasaxc](https://github.com/fasaxc))

- Fixed a bug that a pod's `.status.nominatedNodeName` is not cleared properly, and thus over-occupied system resources. ([#106816](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106816), [@Huang-Wei](https://github.com/Huang-Wei))
- Fixed a bug that caused credentials in an exec plugin to override the static certificates set in a kubeconfig. ([#107410](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107410), [@margocrawf](https://github.com/margocrawf))

- Fixed a bug where a partial `EndpointSlice` update could cause node name information to be dropped from endpoints that were not updated. ([#108198](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108198), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Fixed a bug where unwanted fields were being returned from a `create --dry-run`: uid and, if generateName was used, name. ([#107088](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107088), [@joejulian](https://github.com/joejulian))
- Fixed a bug where vSphere client connections where not being closed during testing. Leaked vSphere client sessions were causing resource exhaustion during automated testing. ([#107337](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107337), [@derek-pryor](https://github.com/derek-pryor))

- Fixed a regression in 1.23 where update requests to previously persisted `Service` objects that have not been modified since 1.19 can be rejected with an incorrect `spec.clusterIPs: Required value` error. ([#107847](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107847), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin))
- Fixed a regression that could incorrectly reject pods with `OutOfCpu` errors if they were rapidly scheduled after other pods were reported as complete in the API. The Kubelet now waits to report the phase of a pod as terminal in the API until all running containers are guaranteed to have stopped and no new containers can be started.  Short-lived pods may take slightly longer (~1s) to report Succeeded or Failed after this change. ([#108366](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108366), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))

- Kube-apiserver: ensures the namespace of objects sent to admission webhooks matches the request namespace. Previously, objects without a namespace set would have the request namespace populated after mutating admission, and objects with a namespace that did not match the request namespace would be rejected after admission. ([#94637](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94637), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Kube-apiserver: removed `apf_fd` from server logs which could contain data identifying the requesting user ([#108631](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108631), [@jupblb](https://github.com/jupblb))

- Modified command line errors (for example, `kubectl list` -> `unknown command`) that were printed as log message with escaped line breaks instead of a multi-line plain text, making the error hard to read. ([#107044](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107044), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- Modified log messages that were logged with `"v":0` in JSON output although they were debug messages with a higher verbosity. ([#106978](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106978), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- No ([#107769](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107769), [@liurupeng](https://github.com/liurupeng)) [SIG Cloud Provider and Windows]

([#107686](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107686), [@gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied))
- Only extend token lifetimes when `--service-account-extend-token-expiration` is true and the requested token audiences are empty or exactly match all values for `--api-audiences`. ([#105954](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105954), [@jyotimahapatra](https://github.com/jyotimahapatra))

- Restored `NumPDBViolations` info of nodes, when `HTTPExtender ProcessPreemption`. This info will be used in subsequent filtering steps - `pickOneNodeForPreemption` ([#105853](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105853), [@caden2016](https://github.com/caden2016))
- Reverted graceful node shutdown to match 1.21 behavior of setting pods that have not yet successfully completed to "Failed" phase if the GracefulNodeShutdown feature is enabled in kubelet. The GracefulNodeShutdown feature is beta and must be explicitly configured via kubelet config to be enabled in 1.21+. This changes 1.22 and 1.23 behavior on node shutdown to match 1.21. If you do not want pods to be marked terminated on node shutdown in 1.22 and 1.23, disable the GracefulNodeShutdown feature. ([#106901](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106901), [@bobbypage](https://github.com/bobbypage))

- The `TopologyAwareHints` feature gate is now enabled by default. This will allow users to opt-in to Topology Aware Hints by setting the `service.kubernetes.io/topology-aware-hints` on a Service. This will not affect any Services without that annotation set. ([#108747](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108747), [@robscott](https://github.com/robscott))
- The deprecated flag `--really-crash-for-testing` was removed. ([#101719](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101719), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev))
- The kubelet no longer forcefully closes active connections on heartbeat failures, using the HTTP2 health check mechanism to detect broken connections. Users can force the previous behavior of the kubelet by setting the environment variable DISABLE_HTTP2. ([#108107](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108107), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- This code change fixes the bug that UDP services would trigger unnecessary LoadBalancer updates. The root cause is that a field not working for non-TCP protocols is considered.

##### Other (Cleanup or Flake)

- Service session affinity timeout tests are no longer required for Kubernetes network plugin conformance due to variations in existing implementations. New conformance tests will be developed to better express conformance in future releases.

- Deprecate apiserver_dropped_requests_total metric. The same data can be read from apiserver_request_terminations_total metric. ([#109018](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/109018), [@wojtek-t](https://github.com/wojtek-t))
- Deprecated types in `k8s.io/apimachinery/util/clock`. Please use `k8s.io/utils/clock` instead. ([#106850](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106850), [@MadhavJivrajani](https://github.com/MadhavJivrajani))
- E2e tests wait for `kube-root-ca.crt` to be populated in namespaces for use with projected service account tokens, reducing delays starting those test pods and errors in the logs. ([#107763](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107763), [@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton))
- Endpoints and EndpointSlice controllers no longer populate [resourceVersion of targetRef](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/object-reference/#ObjectReference) in Endpoints and EndpointSlices ([#108450](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108450), [@tnqn](https://github.com/tnqn))

- Improved algorithm for selecting `best` non-preferred hint in the TopologyManager ([#108154](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108154), [@klueska](https://github.com/klueska))
- Kube-proxy doesn't set the sysctl `net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet=1` if no IPv4 loopback address is selected by the `nodePortAddresses` configuration parameter. ([#107684](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107684), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea))
- Kubeadm: all warning messages are printed to stderr instead of stdout. ([#107467](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107467), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubeadm: handled the removal of dockershim related flags for new kubeadm clusters. If kubelet <1.24 is on the host, kubeadm >=1.24 can continue using the built-in dockershim in the kubelet if the user passes the `{Init|Join}Configuration.nodeRegistration.criSocket` value in the kubeadm configuration to be equal to `unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock` on Unix or `npipe:////./pipe/dockershim` on Windows. If kubelet version >=1.24 is on the host, kubeadm >=1.24 will treat all container runtimes as "remote" using the kubelet flags `--container-runtime=remote --container-runtime-endpoint=scheme://some/path`. The special management for kubelet <1.24 will be removed in kubeadm 1.25. ([#106973](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106973), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: make sure that `kubeadm init/join` always use a URL scheme (unix:// on Linux and npipe:// on Windows) when passing a value to the `--container-runtime-endpoint` kubelet flag. This flag's value is taken from the kubeadm configuration `criSocket` field or the `--cri-socket` CLI flag. Automatically add a missing URL scheme to the user configuration in memory, but warn them that they should also update their configuration on disk manually. During `kubeadm upgrade apply/node` mutate the `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` file on disk and the `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` annotation Node object if needed. These automatic actions are temporary and will be removed in a future release. In the future the kubelet may not support CRI endpoints without an URL scheme. ([#107295](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107295), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: remove the `IPv6DualStack` feature gate. The feature has been GA and locked to enabled since 1.23. ([#106648](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106648), [@calvin0327](https://github.com/calvin0327))
- Kubeadm: removed the deprecated `output/v1alpha1` API used for machine readable output by some kubeadm commands. In 1.23 kubeadm started using the newer version `output/v1alpha2` for the same purpose. ([#107468](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107468), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: removed the restriction that the `ca.crt` can only contain one certificate. If there is more than one certificate in the `ca.crt` file, kubeadm will pick the first one by default. ([#107327](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107327), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu))
- Kubectl stack traces now only print at verbose `-v=99` and not `-v=6` ([#108053](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/108053), [@eddiezane](https://github.com/eddiezane))
- Kubectl: restored `--dry-run`, `--dry-run=true`, and `--dry-run=false` for compatibility with pre-1.23 invocations. ([#107003](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/107003), [@julianvmodesto](https://github.com/julianvmodesto))
- Kubelet config validation error messages are updated. ([#105360](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105360), [@shuheiktgw](https://github.com/shuheiktgw))

#### Bug fixes:

- Added back Ignition support for Vagrant ([coreos-overlay#2351](https://github.com/flatcar/coreos-overlay/pull/2351))
- Added support for hardware security keys in update-ssh-keys ([update-ssh-keys#7](https://github.com/flatcar/update-ssh-keys/pull/7))
- Enabled IOMMU on arm64 kernels, the lack of which prevented some systems from booting ([coreos-overlay#2235](https://github.com/flatcar/coreos-overlay/pull/2235))
- Fixed a regression (in Alpha/Beta) where machines failed to boot if they didnt have the `core` user or group in `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group` ([baselayout#26](https://github.com/flatcar/baselayout/pull/26))
- Fix "ext4 deadlock under heavy I/O load" kernel issue. The patch for this is included provisionally while we wait for it to be merged upstream ([Flatcar#847](https://github.com/flatcar/Flatcar/issues/847), [coreos-overlay#2315](https://github.com/flatcar/coreos-overlay/pull/2315))
- Restored the support to specify OEM partition files in Ignition when `/usr/share/oem` is given as initrd mount point ([bootengine#58](https://github.com/flatcar/bootengine/pull/58))
- The rootfs setup in the initrd now runs systemd-tmpfiles on every boot, not only when Ignition runs, to fix a dbus failure due to missing files ([Flatcar#944](https://github.com/flatcar/Flatcar/issues/944))

#### Changes:

- Added `CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK_BRIDGE` (for nf_conntrack_bridge) and `CONFIG_NFT_BRIDGE_META` (for nft_meta_bridge) to the kernel config to allow using conntrack rules for bridges in nftables and to match on bridge interface names ([coreos-overlay#2207](https://github.com/flatcar/coreos-overlay/pull/2207))
- Added new image signing pub key to `flatcar-install`, needed for download verification of releases built from July 2023 onwards, if you have copies of `flatcar-install` or the image signing pub key, you need to update them as well ([init#92](https://github.com/flatcar/init/pull/92))
- Change CONFIG_WIREGUARD kernel option to module to save space on boot partition ([coreos-overlay#2239](https://github.com/flatcar/coreos-overlay/pull/2239))
- Disable several arch specific arm64 kernel config options for unsupported platforms to save space on boot partition ([coreos-overlay#2239](https://github.com/flatcar/coreos-overlay/pull/2239))
- Specifying the OEM filesystem in Ignition to write files to `/usr/share/oem` is not needed anymore ([bootengine#58](https://github.com/flatcar/bootengine/pull/58))
- Switched from `--strip-unneeded` to `--strip-debug` when installing kernel modules, which makes kernel stacktraces more accurate and makes debugging issues easier ([coreos-overlay#2196](https://github.com/flatcar/coreos-overlay/pull/2196))
- The flatcar-update tool got two new flags to customize ports used on the host while updating flatcar ([init#81](https://github.com/flatcar/init/pull/81))
- Toolbox now uses containerd to download and mount the image ([toolbox#7](https://github.com/flatcar/toolbox/pull/7))
- Add qemu-guest-agent to all amd64 images, it will be automatically enabled when qemu-ga virtio-port is detected ([coreos-overlay#2240](https://github.com/flatcar/coreos-overlay/pull/2240), [portage-stable#373](https://github.com/flatcar/portage-stable/pull/373))

_Changes since **Beta 3510.1.0**_

#### Security fixes:


#### Bug fixes:

- Restored the support to specify OEM partition files in Ignition when `/usr/share/oem` is given as initrd mount point ([bootengine#58](https://github.com/flatcar/bootengine/pull/58))

#### Changes:

- Added new image signing pub key to `flatcar-install`, needed for download verification of releases built from July 2023 onwards, if you have copies of `flatcar-install` or the image signing pub key, you need to update them as well ([init#92](https://github.com/flatcar/init/pull/92))
- Specifying the OEM filesystem in Ignition to write files to `/usr/share/oem` is not needed anymore ([bootengine#58](https://github.com/flatcar/bootengine/pull/58))

#### Updates:

- ca-certificates ([3.89](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/releases/nss_3_89.html))

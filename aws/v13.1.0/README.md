**Security fixes**

*   linux - [CVE-2020-28374](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-28374), [CVE-2020-36158](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36158)
*   go - [CVE-2021-3114](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43786)

**Changes**

*   Revert to building docker and containerd with go1.13 instead of go1.15. This reduces the SIGURG log spam ([Issue #315](https://github.com/kinvolk/Flatcar/issues/315) [PR #774](https://github.com/kinvolk/coreos-overlay/pull/774))
*   The containerd socket is now available in the default location (`/run/containerd/containerd.sock`) and also as a symlink in the previous location (`/run/docker/libcontainerd/docker-containerd.sock`) ([#771](https://github.com/kinvolk/coreos-overlay/pull/771))
*   With the iscsi update, the service unit has changed from iscsid to iscsi ([#791](https://github.com/kinvolk/coreos-overlay/pull/791))

**Updates**

*   linux ([5.4.92](https://lwn.net/Articles/843687/))

*   sudo ([1.9.5p2](https://github.com/sudo-project/sudo/releases/tag/SUDO_1_9_5p2))

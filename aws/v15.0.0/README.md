**Bug fixes**

* Update-engine sent empty requests when restarted before a pending reboot ([Flatcar#388](https://github.com/kinvolk/Flatcar/issues/388))
motd login prompt list of failed services: The output of “systemctl list-units –state=failed –no-legend” contains a bullet point which is not expected and ended up being taken as the unit name of failed units which was previously on the start of the line. Filtered the bullet point out to stay compatible with the old behavior in case upstream would remove the bullet point again. ([coreos-overlay#1042](https://github.com/kinvolk/coreos-overlay/pull/1042))
* The Linux kernel IOMMU-related crash introduced in the 5.10.37 update got fixed through the 5.10.38 update ([Flatcar#400](https://github.com/kinvolk/Flatcar/issues/400))
* Fix the patch to update DefaultTasksMax in systemd ([coreos-overlay#971](https://github.com/kinvolk/coreos-overlay/pull/971))
* GCE: The old interface name ens4v1 which was replaced by eth0 due to a broken udev rule was restored, but now as alternative interface name, and eth0 will stay the primary name for consistency across cloud environments. ([init#38](https://github.com/kinvolk/init/pull/38))

**Changes**

* The virtio network interfaces got predictable interface names as alternative interface names, and thus these names can also be used to match for a specific interface in case there is more than one and the eth0 and eth1 name assignment is not stable. ([init#38](https://github.com/kinvolk/init/pull/38))

### kubernetes [1.20.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.20.8)

#### What's New (Major Themes)

##### Dockershim deprecation

Docker as an underlying runtime is being deprecated. Docker-produced images will continue to work in your cluster with all runtimes, as they always have.
The Kubernetes community [has written a blog post about this in detail](https://blog.k8s.io/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/) with [a dedicated FAQ page for it](https://blog.k8s.io/2020/12/02/dockershim-faq/).

##### External credential provider for client-go

The client-go credential plugins can now be passed in the current cluster information via the `KUBERNETES_EXEC_INFO` environment variable. Learn more about this on [client-go credential plugins documentation](https://docs.k8s.io/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins/).

##### CronJob controller v2 is available through feature gate

An alternative implementation of the `CronJob` controller is now available as an alpha feature in this release, which has experimental performance improvement by using informers instead of polling. While this will be the default behavior in the future, you can [try them in this release through a feature gate](https://docs.k8s.io/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/).

##### PID Limits graduates to General Availability

PID Limits features are now generally available on both `SupportNodePidsLimit` (node-to-pod PID isolation) and `SupportPodPidsLimit` (ability to limit PIDs per pod), after being enabled-by-default in beta stage for a year.

##### API Priority and Fairness graduates to Beta

Initially introduced in 1.18, Kubernetes 1.20 now enables API Priority and Fairness (APF) by default. This allows `kube-apiserver` to [categorize incoming requests by priority levels](https://docs.k8s.io/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/).

##### IPv4/IPv6 run

IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack has been reimplemented for 1.20 to support dual-stack Services, based on user and community feedback. If your cluster has dual-stack enabled, you can create Services which can use IPv4, IPv6, or both, and you can change this setting for existing Services. Details are available in updated [IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack docs](https://docs.k8s.io/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/), which cover the nuanced array of options.

We expect this implementation to progress from alpha to beta and GA in coming releases, so we’re eager to have you comment about your dual-stack experiences in [#k8s-dual-stack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/k8s-dual-stack) or in [enhancements #563](https://features.k8s.io/563). 

##### go1.15.5

go1.15.5 has been integrated into the Kubernetes project as of this release, [including other infrastructure related updates on this effort](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95776).

##### CSI Volume Snapshot graduates to General Availability

CSI Volume Snapshot moves to GA in the 1.20 release. This feature provides a standard way to trigger volume snapshot operations in Kubernetes and allows Kubernetes users to incorporate snapshot operations in a portable manner on any Kubernetes environment regardless of supporting underlying storage providers.
Additionally, these Kubernetes snapshot primitives act as basic building blocks that unlock the ability to develop advanced, enterprise-grade, storage administration features for Kubernetes: including application or cluster level backup solutions.
Note that snapshot support will require Kubernetes distributors to bundle the Snapshot controller, Snapshot CRDs, and validation webhook. In addition, a CSI driver supporting the snapshot functionality must also be deployed on the cluster.

##### Non-recursive Volume Ownership (FSGroup) graduates to Beta

By default, the `fsgroup` setting, if specified, recursively updates permissions for every file in a volume on every mount. This can make mount, and pod startup, very slow if the volume has many files. 
This setting enables a pod to specify a `PodFSGroupChangePolicy` that indicates that volume ownership and permissions will be changed only when permission and ownership of the root directory do not match with expected permissions on the volume.

##### CSIDriver policy for FSGroup graduates to Beta

The FSGroup's CSIDriver Policy is now beta in 1.20. This allows CSIDrivers to explicitly indicate if they want Kubernetes to manage permissions and ownership for their volumes via `fsgroup`. 

##### Security Improvements for CSI Drivers (Alpha)

In 1.20, we introduce a new alpha feature `CSIServiceAccountToken`. This feature allows CSI drivers to impersonate the pods that they mount the volumes for. This improves the security posture in the mounting process where the volumes are ACL’ed on the pods’ service account without handing out unnecessary permissions to the CSI drivers’ service account. This feature is especially important for secret-handling CSI drivers, such as the secrets-store-csi-driver. Since these tokens can be rotated and short-lived, this feature also provides a knob for CSI drivers to receive `NodePublishVolume` RPC calls periodically with the new token. This knob is also useful when volumes are short-lived, e.g. certificates.

##### Introducing Graceful Node Shutdown (Alpha)

The `GracefulNodeShutdown` feature is now in Alpha. This allows kubelet to be aware of node system shutdowns, enabling graceful termination of pods during a system shutdown. This feature can be [enabled through feature gate](https://docs.k8s.io/concepts/architecture/nodes/#graceful-node-shutdown).

##### Runtime log sanitation

Logs can now be configured to use runtime protection from leaking sensitive data. [Details for this experimental feature is available in documentation](https://docs.k8s.io/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/#log-sanitization).

##### Pod resource metrics

On-demand metrics calculation is now available through `/metrics/resources`. [When enabled](
https://docs.k8s.io/concepts/cluster-administration/system-metrics#kube-scheduler-metrics), the endpoint will report the requested resources and the desired limits of all running pods.

##### Introducing `RootCAConfigMap`

`RootCAConfigMap` graduates to Beta, separating from `BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume`. The `kube-root-ca.crt` ConfigMap is now available to every namespace, by default. It contains the Certificate Authority bundle for verify kube-apiserver connections.

##### `kubectl debug` graduates to Beta

`kubectl alpha debug` graduates from alpha to beta in 1.20, becoming `kubectl debug`.
`kubectl debug` provides support for common debugging workflows directly from kubectl. Troubleshooting scenarios supported in this release of `kubectl` include:
Troubleshoot workloads that crash on startup by creating a copy of the pod that uses a different container image or command.
Troubleshoot distroless containers by adding a new container with debugging tools, either in a new copy of the pod or using an ephemeral container. (Ephemeral containers are an alpha feature that are not enabled by default.)
Troubleshoot on a node by creating a container running in the host namespaces and with access to the host’s filesystem.
Note that as a new builtin command, `kubectl debug` takes priority over any `kubectl` plugin named “debug”. You will need to rename the affected plugin.
Invocations using `kubectl alpha debug` are now deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release. Update your scripts to use `kubectl debug` instead of `kubectl alpha debug`!
For more information about kubectl debug, see [Debugging Running Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-running-pod/) on the Kubernetes website, kubectl help debug, or reach out to SIG CLI by visiting [#sig-cli](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-cli) or commenting on [enhancement #1441](https://features.k8s.io/1441).

##### Removing deprecated flags in kubeadm

`kubeadm` applies a number of deprecations and removals of deprecated features in this release. More details are available in the Urgent Upgrade Notes and Kind / Deprecation sections.

##### Pod Hostname as FQDN graduates to Beta

Previously introduced in 1.19 behind a feature gate, `SetHostnameAsFQDN` is now enabled by default. More details on this behavior are available in [documentation for DNS for Services and Pods](https://docs.k8s.io/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-sethostnameasfqdn-field)

##### `TokenRequest` / `TokenRequestProjection` graduates to General Availability

Service account tokens bound to a pod is now a stable feature. The feature gates will be removed in 1.21 release. For more information, refer to notes below on the changelogs.

##### RuntimeClass feature graduates to General Availability.

The `node.k8s.io` API groups are promoted from `v1beta1` to `v1`. `v1beta1` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release, please start using `v1`. ([#95718](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95718), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev)) [SIG Apps, Auth, Node, Scheduling and Testing]

##### Cloud Controller Manager now exclusively shipped by Cloud Provider

Kubernetes will no longer ship an instance of the Cloud Controller Manager binary. Each Cloud Provider is expected to ship their own instance of this binary. Details for a Cloud Provider to create an instance of such a binary can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/staging/src/k8s.io/cloud-provider/sample). Anyone with questions on building a Cloud Controller Manager should reach out to SIG Cloud Provider. Questions about the Cloud Controller Manager on a Managed Kubernetes solution should go to the relevant Cloud Provider. Questions about the Cloud Controller Manager on a non managed solution can be brought up with SIG Cloud Provider.



#### Important Security Information

This release contains changes that address the following vulnerabilities:

##### CVE-2021-25735: Validating Admission Webhook does not observe some previous fields

A security issue was discovered in kube-apiserver that could allow node
updates to bypass a Validating Admission Webhook. You are only affected
by this vulnerability if you run a Validating Admission Webhook for Nodes
that denies admission based at least partially on the old state of the
Node object.

**Note**: This only impacts validating admission plugins that rely on old
values in certain fields, and does not impact calls from kubelet that go
through the built-in NodeRestriction admission plugin.

**Affected Versions**:
  - kube-apiserver v1.20.0 - v1.20.5
  - kube-apiserver v1.19.0 - v1.19.9
  - kube-apiserver <= v1.18.17

**Fixed Versions**:
  - kube-apiserver v1.21.0
  - kube-apiserver v1.20.6
  - kube-apiserver v1.19.10
  - kube-apiserver v1.18.18

This vulnerability was reported by Rogerio Bastos & Ari Lima from RedHat


**CVSS Rating:** Medium (6.5) [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H)



#### Deprecation

- Docker support in the kubelet is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The kubelet uses a module called "dockershim" which implements CRI support for Docker and it has seen maintenance issues in the Kubernetes community. We encourage you to evaluate moving to a container runtime that is a full-fledged implementation of CRI (v1alpha1 or v1 compliant) as they become available. ([#94624](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94624), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG Node]
- Kubeadm: deprecate self-hosting support. The experimental command "kubeadm alpha self-hosting" is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. ([#95125](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95125), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: graduate the "kubeadm alpha certs" command to a parent command "kubeadm certs". The command "kubeadm alpha certs" is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please migrate. ([#94938](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94938), [@yagonobre](https://github.com/yagonobre)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated "kubeadm alpha kubelet config enable-dynamic" command. To continue using the feature please defer to the guide for "Dynamic Kubelet Configuration" at k8s.io. This change also removes the parent command "kubeadm alpha kubelet" as there are no more sub-commands under it for the time being. ([#94668](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94668), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated --kubelet-config flag for the command "kubeadm upgrade node" ([#94869](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94869), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle]
- Kubectl: deprecate --delete-local-data ([#95076](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95076), [@dougsland](https://github.com/dougsland)) [SIG CLI, Cloud Provider and Scalability]
- Kubelet's deprecated endpoint `metrics/resource/v1alpha1` has been removed, please adopt `metrics/resource`. ([#94272](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94272), [@RainbowMango](https://github.com/RainbowMango)) [SIG Instrumentation and Node]
- Removes deprecated scheduler metrics DeprecatedSchedulingDuration, DeprecatedSchedulingAlgorithmPredicateEvaluationSecondsDuration, DeprecatedSchedulingAlgorithmPriorityEvaluationSecondsDuration ([#94884](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94884), [@arghya88](https://github.com/arghya88)) [SIG Instrumentation and Scheduling]
- Scheduler alpha metrics binding_duration_seconds and scheduling_algorithm_preemption_evaluation_seconds are deprecated, Both of those metrics are now covered as part of framework_extension_point_duration_seconds, the former as a PostFilter the latter and a Bind plugin. The plan is to remove both in 1.21 ([#95001](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95001), [@arghya88](https://github.com/arghya88)) [SIG Instrumentation and Scheduling]

#### API Change
- We have added a new Priority & Fairness rule that exempts all probes (/readyz, /healthz, /livez) to prevent 
  restarting of "healthy" kube-apiserver instance(s) by kubelet. ([#101112](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101112), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Fixes using server-side apply with APIService resources ([#100714](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100714), [@kevindelgado](https://github.com/kevindelgado)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]
- Regenerate protobuf code to fix CVE-2021-3121 ([#100501](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100501), [@joelsmith](https://github.com/joelsmith)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, CLI, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Node and Storage]
- Kubernetes is now built using go1.15.8 ([#98962](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/98962), [@cpanato](https://github.com/cpanato)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Instrumentation, Release and Testing]
- `TokenRequest` and `TokenRequestProjection` features have been promoted to GA. This feature allows generating service account tokens that are not visible in Secret objects and are tied to the lifetime of a Pod object. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-token-volume-projection for details on configuring and using this feature. The `TokenRequest` and `TokenRequestProjection` feature gates will be removed in v1.21.
  - kubeadm's kube-apiserver Pod manifest now includes the following flags by default "--service-account-key-file", "--service-account-signing-key-file", "--service-account-issuer". ([#93258](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/93258), [@zshihang](https://github.com/zshihang)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cluster Lifecycle, Storage and Testing]
- A new `nofuzz` go build tag now disables gofuzz support. Release binaries enable this. ([#92491](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92491), [@BenTheElder](https://github.com/BenTheElder)) [SIG API Machinery]
- Add WindowsContainerResources and Annotations to CRI-API UpdateContainerResourcesRequest ([#95741](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95741), [@katiewasnothere](https://github.com/katiewasnothere)) [SIG Node]
- Add a `serving` and `terminating` condition to the EndpointSlice API.
  `serving` tracks the readiness of endpoints regardless of their terminating state. This is distinct from `ready` since `ready` is only true when pods are not terminating. 
  `terminating` is true when an endpoint is terminating. For pods this is any endpoint with a deletion timestamp. ([#92968](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92968), [@andrewsykim](https://github.com/andrewsykim)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- Add dual-stack Services (alpha).  This is a BREAKING CHANGE to an alpha API.
  It changes the dual-stack API wrt Service from a single ipFamily field to 3
  fields: ipFamilyPolicy (SingleStack, PreferDualStack, RequireDualStack),
  ipFamilies (a list of families assigned), and clusterIPs (inclusive of
  clusterIP).  Most users do not need to set anything at all, defaulting will
  handle it for them.  Services are single-stack unless the user asks for
  dual-stack.  This is all gated by the "IPv6DualStack" feature gate. ([#91824](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/91824), [@khenidak](https://github.com/khenidak)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI, Network, Node, Scheduling and Testing]

- Automatic allocation of NodePorts for services with type LoadBalancer can now be disabled by setting the (new) parameter
  Service.spec.allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts=false. The default is to allocate NodePorts for services with type LoadBalancer which is the existing behavior. ([#92744](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/92744), [@uablrek](https://github.com/uablrek)) [SIG Apps and Network]
- Certain fields on  Service objects will be automatically cleared when changing the service's `type` to a mode that does not need those fields.  For example, changing from type=LoadBalancer to type=ClusterIP will clear the NodePort assignments, rather than forcing the user to clear them. ([#95196](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95196), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Network and Testing]
- Document that ServiceTopology feature is required to use `service.spec.topologyKeys`. ([#96528](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96528), [@andrewsykim](https://github.com/andrewsykim)) [SIG Apps]

  - bazel: Replace --features with Starlark build settings flag
  - hack/lib/util.sh: some bash cleanups
    
    - switched one spot to use kube::logging
    - make kube::util::find-binary return an error when it doesn't find
      anything so that hack scripts fail fast instead of with "binary not
      found errors".
    - this required deleting some genfeddoc stuff. the binary no longer
      exists in k/k repo since we removed federation/, and I don't see it
      in https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/ either. I'm assuming
      that it's gone for good now.
  
  - bazel: output go_binary rule directly from go_binary_conditional_pure
    
    From: [@mikedanese](https://github.com/mikedanese):
    Instead of aliasing. Aliases are annoying in a number of ways. This is
    specifically bugging me now because they make the action graph harder to
    analyze programmatically. By using aliases here, we would need to handle
    potentially aliased go_binary targets and dereference to the effective
    target.
  
    The comment references an issue with `pure = select(...)` which appears
    to be resolved considering this now builds.
  
  - make kube::util::find-binary not dependent on bazel-out/ structure
  
    Implement an aspect that outputs go_build_mode metadata for go binaries,
    and use that during binary selection. ([#94449](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94449), [@justaugustus](https://github.com/justaugustus)) [SIG Architecture, CLI, Cluster Lifecycle, Node, Release and Testing]

- Build/lib/release: Explicitly use '--platform' in building server images
  
  When we switched to go-runner for building the apiserver,
  controller-manager, and scheduler server components, we no longer
  reference the individual architectures in the image names, specifically
  in the 'FROM' directive of the server image Dockerfiles.
  
  As a result, server images for non-amd64 images copy in the go-runner
  amd64 binary instead of the go-runner that matches that architecture.
  
  This commit explicitly sets the '--platform=linux/${arch}' to ensure
  we're pulling the correct go-runner arch from the manifest list.
  
  Before:
  `FROM ${base_image}`

  - A namespaced object with an ownerReference referencing a uid of a namespaced kind which does not exist in the same namespace is now consistently treated as though that owner does not exist, and the child object is deleted.
  - A cluster-scoped object with an ownerReference referencing a uid of a namespaced kind is now consistently treated as though that owner is not resolvable, and the child object is ignored by the garbage collector.

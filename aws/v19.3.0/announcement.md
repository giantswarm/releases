**Workload cluster release v19.3.0 for AWS is available**. The new release version is a next preparation phase for the migration away from Pod Security Policies (PSP) in favor of Pod Security Standards (PSS) in Kubernetes 1.25. The `kyverno` included in `observability-bundle` will now be switched to `enforce` mode for PSS. Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/workload-cluster-releases-aws/releases/aws-v19.3.0/).

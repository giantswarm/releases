**Workload cluster release v19.3.0 for AWS is available**. The new release version is the next step in the migration away from Pod Security Policies (PSP) in favor of Pod Security Standards (PSS) in Kubernetes 1.25. The security policies added in v19.1.0 in audit mode will now be enforced to allow for the safe removal of all PSPs from the cluster. Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/workload-cluster-releases-aws/releases/aws-v19.3.0/).

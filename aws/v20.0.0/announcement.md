**Workload cluster release v20.0.0 for AWS is available**. The new major version is the first release supporting Kubernetes `v1.25`. Please remember that with Kubernetes `v1.25` the Pod Security Policies (PSP) are removed from the API, so all workloads must have their PSPs removed *BEFORE* starting the upgrade. From now, on the Pod Security Standards (PSS) are the default for securing the clusters. This release will also be used as a base for Giant Swarm `Vintage` to Giant Swarm adoption of `Cluster API for AWS` (CAPA) migration. Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/workload-cluster-releases-aws/releases/aws-v20.0.0/).

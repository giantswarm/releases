**Workload cluster release v20.0.0 for AWS is available**. The new major version is the first release supporting Kubernetes `1.25`. Please remember that the Pod Security Policies (PSP) are no longer supported in this version and they have to be removed *BEFORE* the upgrade. From now on the Pod Security Standards (PSS) are the default for securing the clusters. This release will also be used as a base for Vintage to CAPA migration. Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/workload-cluster-releases-aws/releases/aws-v20.0.0/).

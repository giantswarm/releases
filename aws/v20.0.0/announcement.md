**Workload cluster release v20.0.0 for AWS is available**. The new major version is the first release supporting Kubernetes `v1.25`. Please remember that with Kubernetes `v1.25` the Pod Security Policies (PSP) are removed from the API, hence customer workloads should also be adjusted *BEFORE* the upgrade. From now on the Pod Security Standards (PSS) are the default for securing the clusters. This release will also be used as a base for Vintage to CAPA migration. Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/workload-cluster-releases-aws/releases/aws-v20.0.0/).

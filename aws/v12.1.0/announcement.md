# :zap: Giant Swarm Release 12.1.0 for AWS :zap:

This release upgrades Cert Manager from upstream v0.9.0 to v0.15.2.

It is part of a larger effort to maximize reliability of upgrades, by keeping 3rd party components within 30 days of upstream releases. 

**This change breaks Cert Manager** due to changes in its API. While the **negative impact to your workloads is low-to-none**, to minimize disruption, **we recommend discussing this upgrade with our Solution Engineer first**.

Further details about changes to individual components can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/giantswarm/releases/blob/master/aws/v12.1.0).

**Workload cluster release v18.1.1 for AWS is available**. This release contains revised allocation calculation on the master nodes. Kubernetes api-server's cpu request are changed to be the half of the **available** CPUs in the VM. This fix will open up more space for other workloads scheduled to run on the master nodes. Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/workload-cluster-releases-aws/releases/aws-v18.1.1/).

> **_Info:_** Cilium support that was introduced in 18.0.0 was rolled back to AWS CNI because of an unresolved upstream bug. Cilium support is postponed to version v19.0.0.

# :zap: This Week in AWS Releases (July 10, 2020):zap:

[AWS v11.4.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/releases/tree/master/aws/v11.4.1) re-activates the recent AWS [release of high-availability (HA) masters](https://github.com/giantswarm/releases/tree/master/aws/v11.4.0) which enables clusters to have three master nodes in different availability zones instead of one master node. It also includes fix for issues with certain OIDC configurations.

Please upgrade [`gsctl`](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/#install) to the latest
version in order to work with the master node high availability functions.

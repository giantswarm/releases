# :zap: This Week in AWS Releases (July 10, 2020):zap:

- [AWS v11.4.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/releases/tree/master/aws/v11.4.1) re-activates the recent AWS [release of high-availability masters](https://github.com/giantswarm/releases/tree/master/aws/v11.4.0) which enables clusters to have three master nodes in different availability zones instead of one master node. It also fixes certain OIDC configuration issues.
Please upgrade [gsctl](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/gsctl/#install) to the latest
version in order to work with the master node high availability functions.

- [AWS v9.3.4](https://github.com/giantswarm/releases/tree/master/aws/v9.3.4) updates managed apps to the latest releases. It also includes security fixes for 3 CVEs.

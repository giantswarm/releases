# :zap: This Week in Azure Releases (July 3, 2020):zap:

[Azure v11.4.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/releases/tree/master/azure/v11.4.0) makes changes to NGINX IC and azure-operator. This **improves IP based security access control, increases concurrent connection capacity, and reduces latency. It also enables configurability of external traffic policy.**

**Please read release notes carefully.** Manual actions are required after the upgrade and we recommend discussing cluster upgrades with your SE.

**Optional Apps Releases**  
(Can be installed from App Catalogs)

1. [Azure AD Pod Identity App](https://github.com/giantswarm/azure-ad-pod-identity-app) can now be installed from the Playground Catalog. This app enables Kubernetes applications to access cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory.
2. [Aqua v4.6.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/aqua-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v462-2020-07-02) is upgraded to the latest version and configured to Aqua's recommended best practices.

# :zap: This week in provider-independent announcements (April 16, 2021) :zap:

For a comprehensive and always-updated view of all new features and changes for apps, workload clusters, UI, and documentation, please check out [changes and releases](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/). Below are the highlights.

## General

We informed you via our user interfaces that Kubernetes v1.18 would run out of support (EOL) by April 8. This was a mistake. The **actual EOL date for v1.18 is April 30**. Apologies for the discomfort we may have caused!

## Managed apps

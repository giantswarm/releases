# :zap: This week in provider-independent announcements (January 29, 2021) :zap:

For a comprehensive and always-updated view of all new features and changes for apps, workload clusters, UI, and documentation, please check out [changes and releases](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/). Below are the highlights.

## Managed apps

[External DNS v2.0.0](waiting for link) allows customers to install and use External DNS for their own purpose, separate from the preinstalled app in AWS and Azure clusters. :warning: [Requires NGINX IC v1.14.0+](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app#limitations).

[Cert Manager v2.4.2](waiting for link) enables automated deletion of secrets when the parent Certificate is deleted, reducing unnecessary alerts.

## Documentation

We re-organized our documentation to make it easier for you to find the content you need. The new left-hand-side menu gives you a better overview and allows to jump quickly. Please let us know what you think!

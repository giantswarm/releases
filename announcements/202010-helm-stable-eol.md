:information_source: On Nov 13, 2020, the upstream Helm `stable` repo will be obsolete. Consequently, so will the "Helm Stable" Catalog in our Web UI (Happa). (See: [Helm Deprecation Timeline](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/README.md#deprecation-timeline))

In case you are using apps installed from the Helm Stable Catalog, please move to following the apps' respective upstream charts or reach out to your Solution Engineer for alternatives.

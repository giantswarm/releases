:information_source: By Nov 13, 2020, the upstream Helm `stable` repo will be deprecated. GitHub will continue to host it. That means the Catalog and its apps will continue to work, but will no longer be updated. (See: [Helm Deprecation Timeline](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/README.md#deprecation-timeline))

The "Helm Stable" Catalog in our Web UI (Happa) will follow suit. We plan to remove it completely in six months, by end of June 2021.

In case you are using apps installed from the Helm Stable Catalog, please move to following the apps' respective upstream charts or reach out to your Solution Engineer for alternatives.

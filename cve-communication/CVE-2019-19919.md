# Security Advisory - CVE-2019-19919

[DATE]

Dear Giant Swarm Community,

We have been made aware of a vulnerability in a third-party component used within our platform.
We take the security of our service very seriously, and are providing this notification to keep you
informed of new developments which may affect your risk.

### What is the Issue?

A vulnerability was discovered in `handlebars`, a Javascript dependency used by our web UI, `happa`:

"CVE-2019-19919: Versions of `handlebars` prior to 4.3.0 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution leading to Remote Code Execution.
Templates may alter an Object's __proto__ and __defineGetter__ properties, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code through crafted payloads."

At this time, we are not aware of any customers who have been adversely affected by this vulnerability. We have since updated the dependency version used by `happa` and are deploying it to all installations.

No action is required on your part.

### kubernetes [1.23.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.23.9)

Upgraded from version 1.22. Please refer to the [official changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md) for all details.

#### What's New (Major Themes)

##### Deprecation of FlexVolume

FlexVolume is deprecated. Out-of-tree CSI driver is the recommended way to write volume drivers in Kubernetes.
See [this doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-storage/volume-plugin-faq.md#kubernetes-volume-plugin-faq-for-storage-vendors) for more information.
Maintainers of FlexVolume drivers should implement a CSI driver and move users of FlexVolume to CSI.
Users of FlexVolume should move their workloads to CSI driver.

##### Deprecation of klog specific flags

To simplify the code base, several [logging flags got marked as deprecated](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-logs/#klog) in Kubernetes 1.23.
The code which implements them will be removed in a future release, so users of those need to start replacing the deprecated flags with some alternative solutions.

##### Software Supply Chain SLSA Level 1 Compliance in the Kubernetes Release Process

Kubernetes releases are now generating provenance attestation files describing the staging and release phases of the release process and artifacts are verified as they are handed over from one phase to the next.
This final piece completes the work needed to comply with Level 1 of the [SLSA security framework](https://slsa.dev/) (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts).

##### IPv4/IPv6 Dual-stack Networking graduates to GA

[IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/563-dual-stack) graduates to GA.
Since 1.21, Kubernetes clusters are enabled to support dual-stack networking by default.
In 1.23, the `IPv6DualStack` feature gate is removed.
The use of dual-stack networking is not mandatory.
Although clusters are enabled to support dual-stack networking, Pods and Services continue to default to single-stack.
To use dual-stack networking: Kubernetes nodes have routable IPv4/IPv6 network interfaces, a dual-stack capable CNI network plugin is used, Pods are configured to be dual-stack and Services have their `.spec.ipFamilyPolicy` field set to either `PreferDualStack` or `RequireDualStack`.

##### HorizontalPodAutoscaler v2 graduates to GA

Version 2 of the HorizontalPodAutoscaler API graduates to stable in the 1.23 release. The HorizontalPodAutoscaler `autoscaling/v2beta2` API is deprecated in favor of the new `autoscaling/v2` API, which the Kubernetes project recommends for all use cases.

This release does *not* deprecate the v1 HorizontalPodAutoscaler API.

##### Generic Ephemeral Volume feature graduates to GA

The generic ephemeral volume feature moved to GA in 1.23.
This feature allows any existing storage driver that supports dynamic provisioning to be used as an ephemeral volume with the volumeâ€™s lifecycle bound to the Pod.
All StorageClass parameters for volume provisioning and all features supported with PersistentVolumeClaims are supported.

##### Skip Volume Ownership change graduates to GA

The feature to configure volume permission and ownership change policy for Pods moved to GA in 1.23.
This allows users to skip recursive permission changes on mount and speeds up the pod start up time.

##### Allow CSI drivers to opt-in to volume ownership and permission change graduates to GA

The feature to allow CSI Drivers to declare support for fsGroup based permissions graduates to GA in 1.23.

##### PodSecurity graduates to Beta

[PodSecurity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) moves to Beta.
`PodSecurity` replaces the deprecated `PodSecurityPolicy` admission controller.
`PodSecurity` is an admission controller that enforces Pod Security Standards on Pods in a Namespace based on specific namespace labels that set the enforcement level.
In 1.23, the `PodSecurity` feature gate is enabled by default.

##### Container Runtime Interface (CRI) v1 is default

The Kubelet now supports the CRI `v1` API, which is now the project-wide default.
If a container runtime does not support the `v1` API, Kubernetes will fall back to the `v1alpha2` implementation.
There is no intermediate action required by end-users, because `v1` and `v1alpha2` do not differ in their implementation.
It is likely that `v1alpha2` will be removed in one of the future Kubernetes releases to be able to develop `v1`.

##### Structured logging graduate to Beta

Structured logging reached its Beta milestone. Most log messages from kubelet and kube-scheduler have been converted. Users are encouraged to try out JSON output or parsing of the structured text format and provide feedback on possible solutions for the open issues, such as handling of multi-line strings in log values.

##### Simplified Multi-point plugin configuration for scheduler

The kube-scheduler is adding a new, simplified config field for Plugins to allow multiple extension points to be enabled in one spot.
The new `multiPoint` plugin field is intended to simplify most scheduler setups for administrators.
Plugins that are enabled via `multiPoint` will automatically be registered for each individual extension point that they implement.
For example, a plugin that implements Score and Filter extensions can be simultaneously enabled for both.
This means entire plugins can be enabled and disabled without having to manually edit individual extension point settings.
These extension points can now be abstracted away due to their irrelevance for most users.

##### CSI Migration updates

CSI Migration enables the replacement of existing in-tree storage plugins such as `kubernetes.io/gce-pd` or `kubernetes.io/aws-ebs` with a corresponding CSI driver.
If CSI Migration is working properly, Kubernetes end users shouldnâ€™t notice a difference.
After migration, Kubernetes users may continue to rely on all the functionality of in-tree storage plugins using the existing interface.
- CSI Migration feature is turned on by default but stays in Beta for GCE PD, AWS EBS, and Azure Disk in 1.23.
- CSI Migration is introduced as an Alpha feature for Ceph RBD and Portworx in 1.23.

#### Urgent Upgrade Notes

##### (No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade)

- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated flag `--experimental-patches` for the `init|join|upgrade` commands. The flag `--patches` is no longer allowed in a mixture with the flag `--config`. Please use the kubeadm configuration for setting patches for a node using `{Init|Join}Configuration.patches`. ([#104065](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104065), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
- Log messages in JSON format are written to stderr by default now (same as text format) instead of stdout. Users who expected JSON output on stdout must now capture stderr instead or in addition to stdout. ([#106146](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106146), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Cluster Lifecycle and Instrumentation]
- Support for the seccomp annotations `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod` and `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/[name]` has been deprecated since 1.19, will be dropped in 1.25. Transition to using the `seccompProfile` API field. ([#104389](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104389), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert))
- [kube-log-runner](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/staging/src/k8s.io/component-base/logs/kube-log-runner) is included in release tar balls. It can be used to replace the deprecated `--log-file` parameter. ([#106123](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106123), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, Cloud Provider, Cluster Lifecycle and Instrumentation]
- Kubernetes is built using golang 1.17. This version of go removes the ability to use a `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` environment setting to re-enable deprecated legacy behavior of treating the CommonName of X.509 serving certificates as a host name. This behavior has been disabled by default since Kubernetes 1.19 / go 1.15. Serving certificates used by admission webhooks, custom resource conversion webhooks, and aggregated API servers must now include valid Subject Alternative Names. If you are running Kubernetes 1.22 with `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` set, check the `apiserver_kube_aggregator_x509_missing_san_total` and `apiserver_webhooks_x509_missing_san_total` metrics for non-zero values to see if the API server is connecting to webhooks or aggregated API servers using certificates that will be considered invalid in Kubernetes 1.23+.

#### Known Issues

##### Etcd v3.5.[0-2] data corruption

Data corruption issue was found in etcd v3.5.0 release that was shipped with 1.22 Kubernetes release. Please read up-to-date [production recommendations for etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/CHANGELOG).

##### Deprecation

- A deprecation notice has been added when using the kube-proxy userspace proxier, which will be removed in v1.25. (#103860) ([#104631](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104631), [@perithompson](https://github.com/perithompson))
- Added `apiserver_longrunning_requests` metric to replace the soon to be deprecated `apiserver_longrunning_gauge` metric. ([#103799](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103799), [@jyz0309](https://github.com/jyz0309))
- Controller-manager: the following flags have no effect and would be removed in v1.24:
  - `--port`
  - `--address`
    The insecure port flags `--port` may only be set to 0 now.
- Kube-scheduler: the `--port` and `--address` flags have no effect and would be removed in v1.24.
  The insecure port flags `--port` may only be set to 0 now.
  Also `metricsBindAddress` and `healthzBindAddress` fields from `kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta1` are no-op and expected to be empty. Removed in `kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta2` completely. ([#96345](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96345), [@ingvagabund](https://github.com/ingvagabund))
  In addition, please be careful that:
  - kube-scheduler MUST start with `--authorization-kubeconfig` and `--authentication-kubeconfig` correctly set to get authentication/authorization working.
  - liveness/readiness probes to kube-scheduler MUST use HTTPS now, and the default port has been changed to 10259.
  - Applications that fetch metrics from kube-scheduler should use a dedicated service account which is allowed to access nonResourceURLs `/metrics`. ([#96345](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/96345), [@ingvagabund](https://github.com/ingvagabund)) [SIG Cloud Provider, Scheduling and Testing]
- Feature-gate `VolumeSubpath` has been deprecated and cannot be disabled. It will be completely removed in 1.25 ([#105474](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105474), [@mauriciopoppe](https://github.com/mauriciopoppe))
- Kubeadm: add a new `output/v1alpha2` API that is identical to the `output/v1alpha1`, but attempts to resolve some internal dependencies with the `kubeadm/v1beta2` API. The `output/v1alpha1` API is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. ([#105295](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105295), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Kubeadm: add the kubeadm specific, Alpha (disabled by default) feature gate UnversionedKubeletConfigMap. When this feature is enabled kubeadm will start using a new naming format for the ConfigMap where it stores the KubeletConfiguration structure. The old format included the Kubernetes version - "kube-system/kubelet-config-1.22", while the new format does not - "kube-system/kubelet-config". A similar formatting change is done for the related RBAC rules. The old format is now DEPRECATED and will be removed after the feature graduates to GA. When writing the ConfigMap kubeadm (init, upgrade apply) will respect the value of UnversionedKubeletConfigMap, while when reading it (join, reset, upgrade), it would attempt to use new format first and fallback to the legacy format if needed. ([#105741](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105741), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123)) [SIG Cluster Lifecycle and Testing]
- Kubeadm: remove the deprecated / NO-OP phase `update-cluster-status` in `kubeadm reset` ([#105888](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105888), [@neolit123](https://github.com/neolit123))
- Remove 'master' as a valid EgressSelection type in the EgressSelectorConfiguration API. ([#102242](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102242), [@pacoxu](https://github.com/pacoxu))
- Removed `kubectl --dry-run` empty default value and boolean values. `kubectl --dry-run` usage must be specified with `--dry-run=(server|client|none)`. ([#105327](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105327), [@julianvmodesto](https://github.com/julianvmodesto))
- Removed deprecated metric `scheduler_volume_scheduling_duration_seconds`. ([#104518](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104518), [@dntosas](https://github.com/dntosas))
- The deprecated `--experimental-bootstrap-kubeconfig` flag has been removed.
  This can be set via `--bootstrap-kubeconfig`. ([#103172](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103172), [@niulechuan](https://github.com/niulechuan))

#### API Change

- A new field `omitManagedFields` has been added to both `audit.Policy` and `audit.PolicyRule`
  so cluster operators can opt in to omit managed fields of the request and response bodies from
  being written to the API audit log. ([#94986](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94986), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cloud Provider and Testing]
- A small regression in Service updates was fixed. The circumstances are so unlikely that probably nobody would ever hit it. ([#104601](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104601), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin))
- Added a feature gate `StatefulSetAutoDeletePVC`, which allows PVCs automatically created for StatefulSet pods to be automatically deleted. ([#99728](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99728), [@mattcary](https://github.com/mattcary))
- Client-go impersonation config can specify a UID to pass impersonated uid information through in requests. ([#104483](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104483), [@margocrawf](https://github.com/margocrawf))
- Create HPA v2 from v2beta2 with some fields changed. ([#102534](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102534), [@wangyysde](https://github.com/wangyysde)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Autoscaling and Testing]
- Ephemeral containers graduated to beta and are now available by default. ([#105405](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105405), [@verb](https://github.com/verb))
- Fix kube-proxy regression on UDP services because the logic to detect stale connections was not considering if the endpoint was ready. ([#106163](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106163), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Architecture, Auth, Autoscaling, CLI, Cloud Provider, Contributor Experience, Instrumentation, Network, Node, Release, Scalability, Scheduling, Storage, Testing and Windows]
- If a conflict occurs when creating an object with `generateName`, the server now returns an "AlreadyExists" error with a retry option. ([#104699](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104699), [@vincepri](https://github.com/vincepri))
- Implement support for recovering from volume expansion failures ([#106154](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106154), [@gnufied](https://github.com/gnufied)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Storage]
- In kubelet, log verbosity and flush frequency can also be configured via the configuration file and not just via command line flags. In other commands (kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager), the flags are listed in the "Logs flags" group and not under "Global" or "Misc". The type for `-vmodule` was made a bit more descriptive (`pattern=N,...` instead of `moduleSpec`). ([#106090](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106090), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Architecture, CLI, Cluster Lifecycle, Instrumentation, Node and Scheduling]

- Introduce `v1beta3` API for scheduler. This version
  - increases the weight of user specifiable priorities.
    The weights of following priority plugins are increased
    - `TaintTolerations` to 3 - as leveraging node tainting to group nodes in the cluster is becoming a widely-adopted practice
    - `NodeAffinity` to 2
    - `InterPodAffinity` to 2

  - Won't have `HealthzBindAddress`, `MetricsBindAddress` fields ([#104251](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104251), [@ravisantoshgudimetla](https://github.com/ravisantoshgudimetla))
- Introduce v1beta2 for Priority and Fairness with no changes in API spec. ([#104399](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104399), [@tkashem](https://github.com/tkashem))
- JSON log output is configurable and now supports writing info messages to stdout and error messages to stderr. Info messages can be buffered in memory. The default is to write both to stdout without buffering, as before. ([#104873](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104873), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))
- JobTrackingWithFinalizers graduates to beta. Feature is enabled by default. ([#105687](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105687), [@alculquicondor](https://github.com/alculquicondor))
- Kube-apiserver: Fixes handling of CRD schemas containing literal null values in enums. ([#104969](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104969), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Kube-apiserver: The `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API version is removed; use the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1` API, available since v1.8. The `scheduling.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API version is removed; use the `scheduling.k8s.io/v1` API, available since v1.14. ([#104248](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104248), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))
- Kube-scheduler: support for configuration file version `v1beta1` is removed. Update configuration files to v1beta2(xref: https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2901) or v1beta3 before upgrading to 1.23. ([#104782](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104782), [@kerthcet](https://github.com/kerthcet))
- KubeSchedulerConfiguration provides a new field `MultiPoint` which will register a plugin for all valid extension points ([#105611](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105611), [@damemi](https://github.com/damemi)) [SIG Scheduling and Testing]
- Kubelet should reject pods whose OS doesn't match the node's OS label. ([#105292](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105292), [@ravisantoshgudimetla](https://github.com/ravisantoshgudimetla)) [SIG Apps and Node]
- Kubelet: turn the KubeletConfiguration v1beta1 `ResolverConfig` field from a `string` to `*string`. ([#104624](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104624), [@Haleygo](https://github.com/Haleygo))
- Kubernetes is now built using go 1.17. ([#103692](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/103692), [@justaugustus](https://github.com/justaugustus))
- Performs strict server side schema validation requests via the `fieldValidation=[Strict,Warn,Ignore]`. ([#105916](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105916), [@kevindelgado](https://github.com/kevindelgado))
- Promote `IPv6DualStack` feature to stable.
  Controller Manager flags for the node IPAM controller have slightly changed:
  1. When configuring a dual-stack cluster, the user must specify both `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4` and `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6` to set the per-node IP mask sizes, instead of the previous `--node-cidr-mask-size` flag.
  2. The `--node-cidr-mask-size` flag is mutually exclusive with `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4` and `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6`.
  3. Single-stack clusters do not need to change, but may choose to use the more specific flags.  Users can use either the older `--node-cidr-mask-size` flag or one of the newer `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4` or `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6` flags to configure the per-node IP mask size, provided that the flag's IP family matches the cluster's IP family (--cluster-cidr).

- Resolves a potential issue with GC and NS controllers which may delete objects after getting a 404 response from the server during its startup. This PR ensures that requests to aggregated APIs will get 503, not 404 while the APIServiceRegistrationController hasn't finished its job. ([#104748](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104748), [@p0lyn0mial](https://github.com/p0lyn0mial))

- The kube-proxy sync_proxy_rules_iptables_total metric now gives
  the correct number of rules, rather than being off by one.
  Fixed multiple iptables proxy regressions introduced in 1.22:
  - When using Services with SessionAffinity, client affinity for an
    endpoint now gets broken when that endpoint becomes non-ready
    (rather than continuing until the endpoint is fully deleted).
  - Traffic to a service IP now starts getting rejected (as opposed to
    merely dropped) as soon as there are no longer any *usable*
    endpoints, rather than waiting until all of the terminating
    endpoints have terminated even when those terminating endpoints
    were not being used.
  - Chains for endpoints that won't be used are no longer output to
    iptables, saving a bit of memory/time/cpu. ([#106030](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/106030), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Network]

- XFS-filesystems are now force-formatted (option `-f`) in order to avoid problems being formatted due to detection of magic super-blocks. This aligns with the behaviour of formatting of ext3/4 filesystems. ([#104923](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/104923), [@davidkarlsen](https://github.com/davidkarlsen))
- `--log-flush-frequency` had no effect in several commands or was missing. Help and warning texts were not always using the right format for a command (`add_dir_header` instead of `add-dir-header`). Fixing this included cleaning up flag handling in component-base/logs: that package no longer adds flags to the global flag sets. Commands which want the klog and `--log-flush-frequency` flags must explicitly call `logs.AddFlags`; the new `cli.Run` does that for commands. That helper function also covers flag normalization and printing of usage and errors in a consistent way (print usage text first if parsing failed, then the error). ([#105076](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/105076), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))

- Reverts graceful node shutdown to match 1.21 behavior of setting pods that have not yet successfully completed to "Failed" phase if the GracefulNodeShutdown feature is enabled in kubelet. The GracefulNodeShutdown feature is beta and must be explicitly configured via kubelet config to be enabled in 1.21+. This changes 1.22 and 1.23 behavior on node shutdown to match 1.21. If you do not want pods to be marked terminated on node shutdown in 1.22 and 1.23, disable the GracefulNodeShutdown feature.

They are now just URL encoded as per Go's implementation of RFC-3986, have duplicate "/" removed from the URL paths, and passed like that directly to the `kube-apiserver` `--etcd-servers` flag. If you have etcd endpoints that have Unicode characters, it is advisable to encode them in advance with tooling that is fully IDNA compliant. If you don't do that, the Go standard library (used in k8s and etcd) would do it for you when making requests to the endpoints.

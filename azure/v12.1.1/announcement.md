**Giant Swarm release v12.1.1 for Azure is available**. This patch release fixes a problem causing the accidental deletion and reinstallation of Preinstalled Apps (such as CoreDNS) in 9.x.x tenant clusters. Please upgrade all older clusters to this version in order to prevent possible downtime. 

If you are upgrading from 12.1.0, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/giantswarm/releases/tree/master/azure/v12.1.1).

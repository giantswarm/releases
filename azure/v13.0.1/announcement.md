Tenant Cluster Release v13.0.1 for Azure is now available. This is the first tenant cluster release to support Kubernetes 1.18 and node pools on Azure. Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/tenant-cluster-releases-azure/releases/azure-v13.0.1/).

Please note the version is v13.0.1 due to problems found with the reconciliation of apps in the unannounced and unused v13.0.0 release.

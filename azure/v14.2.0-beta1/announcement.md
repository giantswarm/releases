**Workload cluster release v14.2.0 beta1 for Azure** is now available.
This release is the first to use `VNet peering` in place of `VPN Gateway` to connect the `workload clusters` with the `management cluster`, allowing 
us to cut several minutes over the workload cluster bootstrap and teardown.  Most workload clusters should be up and running in about 10 minutes from this release on.
Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/workload-cluster-releases-azure/releases/azure-v14.2.0-beta1/).

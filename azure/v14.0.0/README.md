# :zap: Giant Swarm Release v14.0.0 for Azure :zap:

This is the first workload cluster release to support Kubernetes 1.19 on Azure.

Thanks to the [added support by `Azure`](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/germany-west-central-availability-zones-now-generally-available/),
with this release `Availability Zones` are supported for all workload clusters running in the `Germany West Central`
region as well.

Starting from this release, Azure workload clusters include by default a new application named `azure-scheduled-events`
that leverages the [Azure scheduled events](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/scheduled-events)
feature to automatically drain a `Kubernetes` node when the underlying virtual instance is about to be terminated.
This makes the cluster behaviour better when the `cluster autoscaler` scales down a node pool.

Please note that with version `1.19` there a few breaking changes in the `Kubernetes` APIs.
Please refer to the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.19.md#urgent-upgrade-notes)
and feel free to get in touch with your solutions engineer for any concern you might have.

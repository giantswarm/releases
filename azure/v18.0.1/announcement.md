**Workload cluster release v18.0.1 for Azure is available**. This is a bugfix release to fix a problem introduced in 18.0.0 that could lead to `azure-cloud-controller-manager` app to be configured with the wrong Pod CIDR. Upgrading to this release from 18.0.0 will not require rolling of nodes. Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/workload-cluster-releases-azure/releases/azure-v18.0.1/).

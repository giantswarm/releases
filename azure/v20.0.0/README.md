# :zap: Giant Swarm Release v20.0.0 for Azure :zap:

We are happy to announce our first Giant Swarm ClusterAPI alpha release.
Using this release to create cluster means using all the power from ClusterAPI but inside the Giant Swarm product.

## Change details

We are still working on it, but you can already create clusters on a similar fashion you create regular Giant Swarm clusters.
Please notice that since this is an alpha release, the clusters you may create won't be upgradable to next releases.
Also, please don't upgrade your existing clusters to this release.

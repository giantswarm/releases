### containerlinux [2765.2.6](https://www.flatcar-linux.org/releases/#release-2765.2.6)

#### Security fixes
- Linux ([CVE-2020-26558](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26558), [CVE-2021-0129](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-0129), [CVE-2020-24587](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24587), [CVE-2020-24586](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24586), [CVE-2020-24588](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-24588), [CVE-2020-26139](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26139), [CVE-2020-26145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26145), [CVE-2020-26147](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26147), [CVE-2020-26141](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26141), [CVE-2021-3564](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3564), [CVE-2021-28691](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28691), [CVE-2021-3587](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3587), [CVE-2021-3573](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3573))
#### Bug fixes
- Update-engine sent empty requests when restarted before a pending reboot ([Flatcar#388](https://github.com/kinvolk/Flatcar/issues/388))
- motd login prompt list of failed services: The output of "systemctl list-units --state=failed --no-legend" contains a bullet point which is not expected and ended up being taken as the unit name of failed units which was previously on the start of the line. Filtered the bullet point out to stay compatible with the old behavior in case upstream would remove the bullet point again. ([coreos-overlay#1042](https://github.com/kinvolk/coreos-overlay/pull/1042))
#### Updates
- Linux ([5.10.43](https://lwn.net/Articles/859022/))


### cert-exporter [1.7.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-exporter/releases/tag/v1.7.1)

#### Fixed
- Fix configuration version in `Chart.yaml`.


### chart-operator [2.18.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/chart-operator/releases/tag/v2.18.0)

#### Added
- Add releasemaxhistory resource which ensures we retry at a reduced rate when
there are repeated failed upgrades.
#### Changed
- Upgrade Helm release when failed even if version or values have not changed
to handle situations like failed webhooks where we should retry.



### external-dns [2.4.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/releases/tag/v2.4.0)

#### Changed
- Upgrade upstream external-dns from v0.7.6 to [v0.8.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/releases/tag/v0.8.0).
- Allow to configure the minimum interval between two consecutive synchronizations triggered from kubernetes events through `externalDNS.minEventSyncInterval`.



### net-exporter [1.10.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/net-exporter/releases/tag/v1.10.2)

#### Changed
- Allow to customize dns service.
- Only check pod existence on dial errors. Check pod deletion directly by IP instead of listing pods and searching.



### cluster-autoscaler [1.20.3](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-autoscaler-app/releases/tag/v1.20.3)

- Allow users to set container resources

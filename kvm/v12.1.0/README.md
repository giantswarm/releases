## :zap:  Giant Swarm Release 12.1.0 for KVM :zap:

**This release includes two significant improvements to NGINX Ingress Controller. It also includes a fix for Quay being a single point of failure by using Docker mirroring feature. This ensures availability of all images needed for node bootstrap, thus the cluster creation/scaling doesnâ€™t depend on Quay availability anymore.**

**The two NGINX Ingress Controller improvements:**

- First, multiple NGINX Ingress Controllers per tenant cluster are now supported, enabling separation of internal vs external traffic, dev vs prod, and so on.
- Second, management of NGINX IC NodePort Service is moved from kvm-operator to NGINX IC App itself. This enables configurability of external traffic policy and lays the foundation for making NGINX IC App optional and not pre-installed in a future KVM platform release.

Along with kvm-operator, cluster-operator and NGINX IC, release includes several upstream component upgrades.

**Note for cluster upgrades:**

Please manually delete `nginx-ingress-controller` NodePort Service in `kube-system` namespace. Upgrading the cluster then recreates the NodePort Service and moves its management from kvm-operator to NGINX IC. To minimize downtime, please delegate cluster upgrades to your SE.**

**Note for future 12.1.x releases:**

To prevent downtime, please persist this and the above note until all customers are on 12.1.0 and above.

## :zap:  Giant Swarm Release 12.2.0 for KVM :zap:

As of this release, **NGINX Ingress Controller App** is now an **optional (and not pre-installed)** component on KVM.

This enables use of alternative ingress controllers without wasting resources where NGINX is not the preferred option.

**Before upgrading, please ensure cluster is on KVM v12.1.x first.**

You can find more details on components that were changed in the [release notes](https://github.com/giantswarm/releases/tree/master/kvm/v12.2.0).

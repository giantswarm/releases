**Workload cluster release v25.1.1 for CAPA is available**. This release updates cluster-aws to v1.1.2 which allows configuring the node CIDR mask size, toggle the auditd service, and define multiple service account issuers in a certain order (important for migration of Vintage clusters).

Further details can be found in the [release notes](https://docs.giantswarm.io/changes/workload-cluster-releases-capa/releases/aws-25.1.2).

# :zap: Giant Swarm Release v35.0.1 for CAPA :zap:

## Changes compared to v34.5.0

### Components

- cluster-aws from v7.7.3 to v10.0.1
- cluster from v5.3.2 to v8.0.0
- Added containerd [v2.3.2](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v2.3.2)
- Flatcar from v4593.2.4 to [v4593.2.5](https://www.flatcar.org/releases/#release-4593.2.5)
- Kubernetes from v1.34.10 to [v1.35.8](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.35.md#v1.35.8)
- os-tooling from v1.33.1 to v1.34.0

### cluster-aws [v7.7.3...v10.0.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-aws/compare/v7.7.3...v10.0.1)

#### Added

- CI: Run the full set of E2E test suites automatically on release PRs, via `.github/release-pr-body.md`. Towards https://github.com/giantswarm/roadmap/issues/4334
- Add `global.connectivity.certManager.createIamRole` toggle (default `true`) to let customers opt out of provisioning the cert-manager IAM role via crossplane and bring their own role.
- Add optional `architecture` field to node pools (enum `x86_64` / `arm64`, default `x86_64`). When set to `arm64`, `imageLookupFormat` is rendered with an `arm64-` infix so the pool resolves the matching CAPI Flatcar arm64 AMI. Operators are responsible for adding the `kubernetes.io/arch=arm64:NoSchedule` taint via `customNodeTaints` on arm64 pools so amd64-only workloads don't land there. Control plane and existing x86_64 pools are unaffected.
- Apply tags to subnets if they're defined by ID. Clusters that were migrated from Vintage to CAPA have the subnet IDs defined in the values, and we previously didn't render tags for them, so tags did not get reconciled.
- Add `external-dns-crossplane-resources` HelmRelease to manage Route53 records via Crossplane, injecting `clusterName`, `accountID`, `baseDomain`, `oidcDomain`, and `oidcDomains`.

#### Changed

- Update Availability Zones in helm/cluster-aws/files/azs-in-region.yaml
- Chart: Migrate Apps to HelmReleases.
- Extend `arm64` support to Karpenter node pools.
- Make: Fix application variable.
- Fix NTH bundle values nesting.
- Chart: Fix validation errors.
- Support newer Flatcar versions which require a larger root volume size. For ease of migration, enforce at least 15 GB even if a smaller, explicit size is specified in chart values.
- Fix `external-dns` IAM role ARN annotation to use `{name}-external-dns` instead of `{name}-Route53Manager-Role`.
- Extract `aws-oidc-domain` Helm helper (China-aware) and use it in `cert-manager-crossplane-resources` and `external-dns-crossplane-resources` templates.

#### Removed

- Stop passing `image.registry` to the cilium app ([roadmap#3264](https://github.com/giantswarm/roadmap/issues/3264)). `cilium-app` no longer has that value — the registry is part of each image's `repository` there now. The line was already a no-op: `awsContainerImageRegistry` has returned a constant `gsoci.azurecr.io` since #1433 removed its `cn-` branch, which is exactly what the cilium chart already defaults to. Rendered manifests lose only those two lines. `awsContainerImageRegistry` itself stays — coredns, cloud-provider-aws, aws-ebs-csi-driver, karpenter and cilium-cleanup still use it.
- Chart: Remove unused `cluster-shared` library chart dependency.

#### Fixed

- Fix AWS API authentication for cluster-autoscaler by using the correct IAM role name. The `-role` suffix got removed when switching over from operator-created IAM objects to [cluster-autoscaler-crossplane-resources](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-autoscaler-crossplane-resources).
- Correct taint key for ARM instances.
- Allow numbers in Karpenter pool CPU limit (`global.nodePools.*.limits.cpu`).

### cluster [v5.3.2...v8.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster/compare/v5.3.2...v8.0.0)

#### Added

- Add `cert-manager-crossplane-resources` HelmRelease.
- Feature Gates: Add support for defining maximum Kubernetes version.
- Apps: Add External DNS Crossplane Resources.
- Apps: Deploy `cluster-autoscaler` inCluster in Azure.
- MachineDeployment: Add CAPI autoscaler annotations (`cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-min-size`/`max-size`) when `minSize`/`maxSize` are set on a node pool (only in Azure).
- Apps: Add Cluster Autoscaler Crossplane Resources.
- Control Plane: Add Kamaji control plane support with `KamajiControlPlane` resource, Kamaji etcd HelmRelease, automation RBAC, and cleanup jobs. ([#740](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster/pull/740))

#### Changed

- Chart: Migrate Apps to HelmReleases.
- Migrate `coredns` HelmRelease values to the new `coredns-app` zone-aware interface.
- Rename the internal `coredns` control plane helper to align with the `controlPlane` values key.
- Updated `cert-manager` to v4.0.0 and migrated the values to match the new chart's schema.
- Support templating on the `global.apps.<name>.extraConfigs.name` field.
- Add support for AKS clusters
- Add support for disabling the external autoscaler annotation (`cluster.x-k8s.io/replicas-managed-by: "external-autoscaler"`) on `MachinePools`.
- Refactor `providerIntegration.resourcesApi.machinePoolResourcesEnabled` into an object `providerIntegration.resourcesApi.machinePoolResources` and move `externalAutoscaler` under it (now `providerIntegration.resourcesApi.machinePoolResources.externalAutoscaler`).
- Bump Flux OCIRepository version to v1.
- Control Plane: Remove handling of clusterRole resources for kamaji Datastore CRs and create kamaji-etcd polex here.
- Control Plane: Make etcd image tag configurable. ([#841](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster/pull/841))
- Chart: Require `global.release.version` if using Releases to give a better rendering error message.
- Chart: Fix validation errors.
- Configure `observability-bundle` with the management cluster name.
- Apps: Skip `kyverno-crds` dependency for `cluster-autoscaler` when deployed inCluster.
- Apps: Add cluster-probes HelmRelease to deploy ServiceMonitors for probing workload cluster API server endpoint from the management cluster. Configurable via `global.apps.clusterProbes` with default module `http_2xx_insecure` for self-signed certificates.
- Helpers: Use `.Chart.AppVersion` in `app.kubernetes.io/version` label.
- Cluster API: Migrate to API `v1beta2`.

#### Removed

- Cluster API: Remove `strategy.rollingUpdate.deletePolicy` from node pools.

#### Fixed

- Control Plane: Ensure components start correctly when SELinux is set to enforcing.

### aws-ebs-csi-driver [v4.1.2...v4.3.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/aws-ebs-csi-driver-app/compare/v4.1.2...v4.3.1)

#### :warning: Breaking Changes

- **Workload chart renamed** from `aws-ebs-csi-driver-app` to `aws-ebs-csi-driver`. The OCI catalog artifact name changes accordingly.
- **Bundle values restructured**: upstream chart values are now under the `upstream:` key in the bundle `values.yaml`. The `giantswarm.workloadValues` helper handles the transformation automatically, so bundle users only need to place overrides under `upstream:` in their App CR ConfigMap.
- **Direct workload chart install**: if installing the workload chart directly (without the bundle), all upstream values must be under the `upstream:` key, and extras (`verticalPodAutoscaler`, `networkPolicy`, `global.podSecurityStandards`) are at the top level.

#### Added

- HelmRelease: Add dependencies.
- Add IRSA environment variables (`AWS_ROLE_ARN`, `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`), projected ServiceAccountToken volume, and `AWS_REGION` to the EBS CSI controller, enabling IRSA authentication in CAPA clusters.
- Propagate proxy values from the bundle (`proxy.http`, `proxy.noProxy`) to the upstream chart (`proxy.http_proxy`, `proxy.no_proxy`) when set.

#### Changed

- Run the e2e test suites automatically on release PRs by adding `.github/release-pr-body.md`.
- Add `io.giantswarm.application.audience: all` annotation to publish the app to the customer Backstage catalog.
- Migrate chart metadata annotations to `io.giantswarm.application.*` format for both the app and bundle charts.

#### Fixed

- Re-enable metrics, force use of `ServiceMonitor` to avoid rendering without them if CRDs are not installed yet
- Fix VPA `updateMode` for `ebs-csi-node` DaemonSet from `Auto` to `Initial`. VPA cannot evict DaemonSet pods, so `Auto` mode silently produces recommendations without ever applying them. `Initial` correctly sets resources at pod creation time.

### aws-nth-bundle [v1.4.0...v2.1.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/aws-nth-bundle/compare/v1.4.0...v2.1.1)

#### Added

- Make the `aws-node-termination-handler` HelmRelease `dependsOn` list configurable via `awsNodeTerminationHandler.dependsOn`.
- Add `cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-name` label to the HelmReleases.
- Add Flux `dependsOn` from the `aws-node-termination-handler` HelmRelease to the `prometheus-operator-crd` HelmRelease.

#### Changed

- Bump OCIRepository version to v1.
- AWS Node Termination Handler: Force resource updates on upgrade.
- Use `gsoci.azurecr.io/giantswarm/aws-node-termination-handler` for the container image.
- Fix the Flux HelmRelease remediation policy (always remediate).
- Deploy Crossplane resources directly from the bundle instead of standalone helmrelease.
- Clean up values and helm template functions.
- Remove `cluster-values` ConfigMap reference from `aws-node-termination-handler` HelmRelease. Pass `clusterID` explicitly via inline values instead.

### aws-pod-identity-webhook [v2.2.0...v2.3.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/aws-pod-identity-webhook/compare/v2.2.0...v2.3.0)

#### Changed

- Add `io.giantswarm.application.audience: all` annotation to publish the app to the customer Backstage catalog.
- Migrate chart metadata annotations to `io.giantswarm.application.*` format.
- Use Helm `appVersion` as the default version for the restarter container image.

### cert-exporter [v2.10.1...v2.12.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-exporter/compare/v2.10.1...v2.12.0)

#### Added

- Regression tests covering the v2.11.1 metrics endpoint fix: concatenated and repeated certificates in secrets and files, and an endpoint level test asserting `/metrics` keeps returning 200 and serving the remaining metrics when a duplicate series is emitted.
- ATS: End to end test for a TLS secret whose `tls.crt` holds a concatenated certificate chain.

#### Changed

- ATS: `cert_gen` now sets a certificate serial number, which defaulted to `0` for every generated certificate.
- Go: Update dependencies.
- Templates: Move PolicyException to `kube-system` namespace.
- Build and publish a multi-arch (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) container image. Required so the cert-exporter daemonset can run on Graviton/arm64 nodepools without `exec format error`.

#### Fixed

- Add a `serialnumber` label to the `cert_exporter_not_after` and `cert_exporter_secret_not_after` metrics so concatenated certificates no longer collide into identical series. The collision made the registry fail `Gather()`, which blanked out the entire `/metrics` endpoint (regression from v2.10.1).
- Serve `/metrics` with `ContinueOnError` so a single problematic metric can no longer fail the whole scrape.

### cert-manager [v3.13.0...v4.1.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-app/compare/v3.13.0...v4.1.1)

#### Changed

- Upgrade `docker-kubectl` image to support arm64 architecture
- Updated `cert-manager` to upstream version `v1.20.3`.
- **Notes:** `cert-manager-edit` ClusterRole no longer grants `create` on `challenges.acme.cert-manager.io`, nor `create`/`patch`/`update` on `orders.acme.cert-manager.io`.
- Improved proxy settings by adding a proxy ConfigMap and setting upstream `envFrom` values for `controller`, `webhook` and `cainjector`.
- **Breaking:** Helm values to be passed to the upstream `cert-manager` chart will now need to use the `cert-manager` path instead of root. For example, the value `crds.enabled: true` must now be set with `cert-manager.crds.enabled: true`.
- Moved vendored chart to `helm/cert-manager/charts/` and adapted sync scripts to follow new structure.

### cert-manager-crossplane-resources [v0.1.1...v0.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-manager-crossplane-resources/compare/v0.1.1...v0.2.0)

#### Added

- Add `WorkloadIdentity` resource for AKS provider.

### cilium [v1.4.3...v1.5.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/cilium-app/compare/v1.4.3...v1.5.1)

#### Added

- `sync/verify-images.sh`, run as the last step of `sync/sync.sh` and therefore in CI: renders the chart across four scenarios covering every image-bearing component and fails the sync unless each image is served from `gsoci.azurecr.io/giantswarm/` or is explicitly listed in `sync/unmirrored-images.txt`. It also asserts that every configured image actually appears in a render, so a scenario that stops covering an image fails instead of silently narrowing the check. This replaces the removed patch's `fail` guards, which were the only thing that made image drift visible on an upstream bump.

#### Changed

- Upgrade Cilium to [v1.19.7](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.19.7).
- Run the E2E test suites automatically on release PRs by adding `.github/release-pr-body.md`.
- Upgrade Cilium to [v1.19.6](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.19.6).
- Switch Hubble TLS certificate provisioning from `hubble.tls.auto.method: helm` to `cronJob` ([giantswarm#37201](https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm/issues/37201)). The helm method minted certificates once and never renewed them, deterministically breaking hubble-relay when the leaf certs (1 year) or the CA (3 years) expired. With the cronJob method a `hubble-generate-certs` CronJob re-issues the leaf certificates every 4 months. **On upgrade, the Helm-owned `cilium-ca`, `hubble-server-certs` and `hubble-relay-client-certs` secrets are deleted and re-created by a one-shot certgen job with a fresh 3-year CA; agents and hubble-relay hot-reload the new certificates without restarts.**
- Wire certgen's `--ca-enforce-validity-throughout-leaves-duration` flag (new value `certgen.enforceCAValidityThroughoutLeavesDuration`, default `true`): the certgen job now fails roughly one year before the CA would no longer cover new leaf certificates, instead of silently issuing leafs that outlive the CA. certgen never rotates an existing CA on its own ([cilium/certgen#500](https://github.com/cilium/certgen/issues/500)).
- Relax `hubble-relay` `podAffinity` to `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` so Karpenter can drain the last cilium-agent-bearing node during upgrades/consolidation instead of getting stuck on a required co-location with cilium.
- Upgrade Cilium to [v1.19.5](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.19.5).
- Upgrade Cilium to [v1.19.4](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.19.4).

#### Removed

- **Removed the `image.registry` value and the sync patch behind it** ([roadmap#3264](https://github.com/giantswarm/roadmap/issues/3264)). The registry is now part of each image's `repository` value, exactly as upstream ships it, so the chart no longer patches upstream's `cilium.image`/`cilium.operator.image` helpers into a `(list $ <image>)` signature and no longer rewrites all 35 call sites with `sed`. `helm/cilium/templates/_helpers.tpl` and `helm/cilium/templates/cilium-operator/_helpers.tpl` are now byte-identical to upstream, and 15 template patches disappear from `diffs/`.

#### Fixed

- Fix four image references that were rendered as unpullable double-prefixed paths, because their `repository` already carried a registry while the removed patch prefixed `image.registry` on top: `gsoci.azurecr.io/ghcr.io/spiffe/spire-server`, `.../spire-agent`, `.../docker.io/library/busybox` (SPIRE mutual authentication) and `.../docker.io/istio/ztunnel` (`encryption.type=ztunnel`). All four now resolve. Latent until now because both features are disabled by default.
- Fix rendering of the certgen job specs (`hubble/tls-cronjob` and `clustermesh-apiserver/tls-cronjob`): the image reference was not converted to the Giant Swarm `cilium.image` helper signature because the image-registries sync patch only processed `*.yaml` templates, so enabling the cronJob method failed with `required list, but got "map"`.
- Add NetworkPolicies allowing the `hubble-generate-certs` and `clustermesh-apiserver-generate-certs` certgen pods egress to the Kubernetes API.

### cilium-crossplane-resources [v0.2.1...v0.2.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/cilium-crossplane-resources/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2)

#### Changed

- CircleCI: Update `architect-orb` so this chart also gets pushed to the OCI registry.

### cilium-servicemonitors [v0.1.4...v0.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cilium-servicemonitors-app/compare/v0.1.4...v0.2.0)

#### Added

- Add per-monitor `enabled` flag for the agent, hubble and operator.

#### Changed

- Switch all monitors from ServiceMonitor to PodMonitor.

### cluster-autoscaler [v1.34.3-2...v2.0.4](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-autoscaler-app/compare/v1.34.3-2...v2.0.4)

#### Changed

- Templates: Move PolicyException to `kube-system` namespace.
- Chart: Update to upstream v1.35.1.
- Templates: Move PolicyException to `giantswarm` namespace.
- RBAC: Grant access to DeviceClasses and ResourceClaims.
- RBAC: Grant access to `resourceslices.resource.k8s.io`.
- Helpers: Trim `.` suffix.
- Chart: Update to upstream v1.35.0.

### cluster-autoscaler-crossplane-resources [v1.0.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-autoscaler-crossplane-resources/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

#### Added

- Chart: Add IAM role.

#### Changed

- CircleCI: Push to `cluster-catalog`.

### coredns [v1.30.0...v1.32.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/coredns-app/compare/v1.30.0...v1.32.0)

#### Added

- Wire up the full set of CoreDNS `forward`, `cache`, and `kubernetes` block parameters in the structured zone config:
  - `forward`: `maxIdleConns`, `maxConnectAttempts`, `dohMethod`, `tls`, `tlsServername`, `next`, `nextOnNodata`, `failfastAllUnhealthyUpstreams`, `failover`, `resolver`.
  - `cache`: `zones`, `serveStale.verifyTimeout`, `disable.successZones`, `disable.denialZones`.
  - `kubernetes`: `endpoint`, `tls`, `kubeconfig`, `apiserverQPS`, `apiserverBurst`, `apiserverMaxInflight`, `namespaceLabels`, `fallthroughZones`, `multicluster`, `startupTimeout`.

#### Changed

- Chart: Make tolerations configurable.
- Rebuild with `app-build-suite` 2.2.0 (via `architect` orb 9.6.0): the packaged chart now carries Artifact Hub metadata (`artifacthub.io/license` and a Support link). No functional chart changes.
- Standardize `values.yaml` comments to the `# @schema` / `# --` (helm-docs) convention and remove section-header dividers, so `values.schema.json` and the chart `README.md` are generated from the values file. Rendered manifests are unchanged.
- Update `coredns` image to [1.14.4](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.14.4).
- update CoreDNS icon to light version
- Update `coredns` image to [1.14.3](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.14.3).

#### Fixed

- Render the `health` directive in only the `.` server block. The health plugin is process-wide and can be enabled in just one Server Block, so emitting it in every zone block was invalid. `ready` is kept in every block (its readiness is aggregated across blocks).
- Correct the `coredns.*.cache.serveStale.refreshMode` schema enum to `immediate`/`verify` (was `immediate`/`background`), matching the CoreDNS cache plugin.

### etcd-defrag [v1.2.6...v1.2.10](https://github.com/giantswarm/etcd-defrag-app/compare/v1.2.6...v1.2.10)

#### Changed

- Chart: Update dependency ahrtr/etcd-defrag to v0.43.0. ([#125](https://github.com/giantswarm/etcd-defrag-app/pull/125))
- Chart: Update dependency ahrtr/etcd-defrag to v0.42.0. ([#120](https://github.com/giantswarm/etcd-defrag-app/pull/120))
- Chart: Update dependency ahrtr/etcd-defrag to v0.41.0. ([#108](https://github.com/giantswarm/etcd-defrag-app/pull/108))
- Chart: Update dependency ahrtr/etcd-defrag to v0.40.0. ([#94](https://github.com/giantswarm/etcd-defrag-app/pull/94))

### external-dns [v3.4.0...v3.5.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/compare/v3.4.0...v3.5.0)

#### Changed

- Update VPA `updatePolicy.updateMode` from deprecated `Auto` to `Recreate`.
- Upgrade external-dns to [v0.21.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/releases/tag/v0.21.0).
- Sync to upstream helm chart [1.21.1](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/releases/tag/external-dns-helm-chart-1.21.1).
  - Add `namespaceOverride` value to support deploying external-dns into a different namespace than the Helm release (useful for subchart usage).
  - Add `enableGatewayListenerSets` value to opt into Gateway API ListenerSet resource support.
  - Add `sourceNamespace` value (used with `namespaced=true`) to watch resources in a namespace different from the deployment namespace.
  - Avoid creating cluster-scoped namespace RBAC when `gatewayNamespace` is set, reducing required permissions.
  - Fix `extraArgs` map handling: boolean values now render as `--flag` / `--no-flag` and string values are properly quoted.
- Use external-dns.namespace in VPA and NetworkPolicy resources.

### external-dns-crossplane-resources [v0.4.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-crossplane-resources/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

#### Added

- Add configurable `serviceAccount.name`/`serviceAccount.namespace` and `azure.mountPath` values.

#### Changed

- Scope AWS values under `aws.*`. Root-level values remain supported as a fallback for backward compatibility.
- Templatize hardcoded resource, service account and tag values.
- Scope the IAM trust policy to the exact `serviceAccount` subject instead of a wildcard match.
- Enable Azure Workload Identity for the `azure` provider in addition to `aks`.
- Update chart metadata to reflect Azure support.

#### Removed

- Remove unused `baseDomain` value.

### irsa-servicemonitors [v0.1.1...v0.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/irsa-servicemonitors-app/compare/v0.1.1...v0.2.0)

#### Fixed

- Add `probe_target` label to ensure unique synthetic metrics

### karpenter [v2.3.0...v2.4.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/karpenter-app/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.1)

#### Added

- HelmRelease: Add dependencies.
- Add `cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-name` label to the karpenter HelmRelease.
- Add `iam:GetInstanceProfile` permission to Karpenter IAM role.
- Add karpenter CRDs.
- Set `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` on the karpenter CRDs so they survive HelmRelease uninstall and prevent cascade-deleting `NodePool`/`NodeClaim`/`EC2NodeClass` resources.

#### Changed

- Run the E2E test suites automatically on release PRs by adding `.github/release-pr-body.md`.
- Bump OCIRepository to v1.
- Chart: Move PolicyException to `kube-system` to avoid depending on creation of the `policy-exceptions` namespace.
- Switch e2e scale test from App CR to Flux HelmRelease for deploying hello-world, avoiding `values-schema-violation` errors caused by app-platform injected properties.
- Improve Crossplane ConfigMap fetching logic

#### Removed

- Removed `global.podSecurityStandards.enforced` helm value. The Kyverno `PolicyException` in `pss-exceptions.yaml` is now rendered unconditionally.

### karpenter-taint-remover [v1.0.2...v1.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/capa-karpenter-taint-remover/compare/v1.0.2...v1.1.0)

- Migrate chart metadata annotations to `io.giantswarm.application.*` format.

### net-exporter [v1.23.1...v1.24.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/net-exporter/compare/v1.23.1...v1.24.0)

#### Changed

- Build and publish a multi-arch (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) container image. Required so the net-exporter daemonset can run on Graviton/arm64 nodepools without `exec format error`.
- Bump `docker-kubectl` init container from `1.25.4` to `1.36.0`.

### network-policies [v0.1.3...v0.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/network-policies-app/compare/v0.1.3...v0.2.0)

#### Added

- Add support for AKS selector labels.

#### Changed

- Deprecated the .Values.kamaji in favour of the more generic .Values.konnectivityAgent to control the behaviour for the `konnectivity-agent`.

### node-exporter [v1.20.11...v1.20.13](https://github.com/giantswarm/node-exporter-app/compare/v1.20.11...v1.20.13)

#### Changed

- CircleCI: Do not override app version.
- Chart: Move PolicyException to `kube-system` namespace.

### observability-bundle [v2.8.0...v3.3.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/observability-bundle/compare/v2.8.0...v3.3.1)

#### Added

- Add KSM metrics for Gateway API `ListenerSet` and `ReferenceGrant` resources.
- Add Backstage audience annotations.
- Add managementCluster: "" as a top-level value (populated from the cluster chart via defaultValues)
- Moves full KSM metricRelabelings ownership from kube-prometheus-stack-app into observability-bundle

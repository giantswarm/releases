**Workload cluster release v29.6.0 for CAPA is available**. This release reduces IAM permissions on the worker nodes instance profile, aiming at improving the general security of the clusters. Additional changes include reducing the size of the ETCD volume to 50GB targetting costs saving initiatives, as well as improvements for the `node-termination-handler` application for smoother upgrades and operations. Several components such as Flatcar or Kubernetes have also been updates to the latest available versions.

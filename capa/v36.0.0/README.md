### cert-exporter [v2.12.0...v2.12.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/cert-exporter/compare/v2.12.0...v2.12.1)

#### Fixed

- A cert file that cannot be read no longer aborts the scan of its whole cert path. Previously one unreadable file (such as a root-only `0600` `ca.crt` on an AKS node, where the exporter runs as an unprivileged user) stopped the walk, silently dropping every file sorting after it from the metrics. Unreadable files are now logged and skipped individually.

### cilium [v1.5.1...v1.6.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cilium-app/compare/v1.5.1...v1.6.0)

#### Changed

- Upgrade Cilium to [v1.20.1](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/releases/tag/v1.20.1) from v1.19.7. Please review the upstream [1.20 upgrade notes](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.20/operations/upgrade/) before rolling this out.
- Serve the ztunnel image from `gsoci.azurecr.io/giantswarm/cilium-ztunnel` instead of pulling it from upstream. Cilium v1.20 moved this image from `docker.io/istio/ztunnel` to `quay.io/cilium/ztunnel:v1.0.0`, and our mirror carries exactly that digest, so it no longer has to be allow-listed in `sync/unmirrored-images.txt`. Only used by `encryption.type=ztunnel`, which we do not support.

#### Removed

- Upstream removed these long-deprecated Helm values in v1.20. None of them are set by this chart's defaults, and because the chart's `values.schema.json` does not reject unknown keys, leftovers in existing values are **silently ignored** rather than rejected — check your values before upgrading:
  - `encryption.strictMode.{enabled,cidr,allowRemoteNodeIdentities}` → use `encryption.strictMode.egress.*`
  - `encryption.ipsec.encryptedOverlay`
  - `clustermesh.enableMCSAPISupport` → use `clustermesh.mcsapi.enabled` (MCS-API is now stable upstream)
  - `clustermesh.apiserver.tls.{server,admin,remote}.{cert,key}` and `clustermesh.apiserver.tls.enableSecrets` → enable auto-generation or pre-create the secrets
  - `hubble.redact.kafka.apiKey` → Kafka-aware L7 policy support and proxylib were removed upstream
  - `preflight.tofqdnsPreCache` → the preflight FQDN poller was removed upstream
  - `hubble.ui.backend.{livenessProbe,readinessProbe}.enabled`
- `sync/patches/certgen/`. Cilium v1.20 ships the `certgen.enforceCAValidityThroughoutLeavesDuration` value and wires `--ca-enforce-validity-throughout-leaves-duration` into both certgen job specs itself, so the Giant Swarm patch that added them became a no-op (it detected this and skipped). The default stays `true` and the rendered job specs are unchanged, so two more patches drop out of `diffs/`.

### cloud-provider-aws [v2.1.0...v2.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/aws-cloud-controller-manager-app/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0)

#### Added

- Add E2E tests

#### Changed

- Add `io.giantswarm.application.audience: all` annotation to publish the app to the customer Backstage catalog.
- Migrate chart metadata annotations to `io.giantswarm.application.*` format.
- Chart: Update to upstream v1.36.1.

### cluster-autoscaler [v2.0.4...v2.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/cluster-autoscaler-app/compare/v2.0.4...v2.1.0)

#### Changed

- Chart: Update to upstream v1.36.1.

### coredns [v1.32.0...v1.33.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/coredns-app/compare/v1.32.0...v1.33.0)

#### Changed

- Update `coredns` image to [1.14.6](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.14.6).
- Run the E2E test suites automatically on release PRs by adding `.github/release-pr-body.md`.

#### Fixed

- Honor the deprecated `configmap.log`, `loadbalancePolicy` and `configmap.cache` again. Since 1.31.0 `coredns.<zone>.log`, `coredns.<zone>.loadbalance` and `coredns.<zone>.cache.success.ttl` shipped defaults that shadowed them, so the old keys were silently ignored. They are now unset by default, restoring the documented fallback chain. Rendering with default values is unchanged.

### etcd-defrag [v1.2.10...v1.2.12](https://github.com/giantswarm/etcd-defrag-app/compare/v1.2.10...v1.2.12)

#### Changed

- Chart: Update dependency ahrtr/etcd-defrag to v0.45.0. ([#136](https://github.com/giantswarm/etcd-defrag-app/pull/136))
- Chart: Update dependency ahrtr/etcd-defrag to v0.44.0. ([#129](https://github.com/giantswarm/etcd-defrag-app/pull/129))

### network-policies [v0.2.0...v0.3.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/network-policies-app/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.1)

#### Added

- Add `keywords` to `Chart.yaml`.
- Declare the `io.giantswarm.application.audience` (`all`) and
- Add optional `denyEgressToIMDS` policy denying pod egress to the instance metadata service. Disabled by default.
- Add apptest-framework e2e test suite.

#### Changed

- Always exclude the `karpenter` and `aws-load-balancer-controller` namespaces from `denyEgressToIMDS`.
- Move the team annotation from the legacy `application.giantswarm.io/team` key to

### node-exporter [v1.20.13...v1.21.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/node-exporter-app/compare/v1.20.13...v1.21.0)

#### Added

- `disableSystemdCollector` value to turn the systemd collector off, mirroring the existing `disableConntrackCollector` and `disableNvmeCollector` toggles. The collector needs a D-Bus connection to the host, which is refused on nodes where AppArmor mediates D-Bus (such as AKS Ubuntu nodes running under the default containerd profile), making it fail on every scrape. Defaults to `false`, so behaviour is unchanged.

### observability-bundle [v3.3.1...v3.5.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/observability-bundle/compare/v3.3.1...v3.5.0)

#### Added

- Point kube-prometheus-stack's control-plane ServiceMonitors at the alloy-metrics token Secret.

#### Changed

- Update `alloy` apps to 0.23.1 (Alloy v1.19.2).
- Update `prometheus-operator-crd` to 24.0.0 (Prometheus Operator CRDs v0.94.0).
- Update `kube-prometheus-stack` to 24.0.0 (chart 91.2.3, Prometheus Operator v0.94.0).
- Values: Update Prometheus Operator CRD and Kube Prometheus Stack to v23.0.0.

#### Fixed

- KSM custom resource state: Set the Gateway API `TCPRoute` and `UDPRoute` collectors to `v1`, which is the version the API server serves.

### prometheus-blackbox-exporter [v0.9.0...v0.10.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/prometheus-blackbox-exporter-app/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0)

#### Added

- Probe `github.com`, `gsoci.azurecr.io` and `grafana.com` from every node (targets `egress-github`, `egress-registry`, `egress-grafana`), so an allowlist-style firewall change blocking a single domain becomes visible. The new `serviceMonitor.externalTargets` value is a map so per-installation, per-region or per-customer overrides can disable, change or add individual entries without copying the whole list. A separate `serviceMonitor.additionalExternalTargets` key takes regional/customer additions, structurally separated from the Giant Swarm defaults. Adds the `http_2xx_or_401` module for registry endpoints that answer unauthenticated requests with 401. See giantswarm/giantswarm#33409.
- Add the `http_2xx_egress` module, used by the internet egress targets. It carries a 15s timeout so `probe_success` reports whether an endpoint is reachable rather than whether it is fast. It is a separate module rather than a longer timeout on `http_2xx` because several installations pin `http_2xx` in their own custom values, which would silently revert the change there.

#### Removed

- Remove the inert `instance` metric relabeling from the ServiceMonitor template. It interpolated a `url` field that no target defines, so it rendered empty and Prometheus fell back to its `$1` default, leaving `instance` unchanged.

#### Fixed

- Give the internet egress targets a probe deadline above the cross-border baseline: `scrapeTimeout: 20s` on `http-giantswarm`, `egress-github`, `egress-registry` and `egress-grafana`, and a 15s timeout on `http_2xx_or_401`. The exporter applies `min(module timeout, scrapeTimeout - 0.5s offset)`, so the 5s `serviceMonitor.defaults.scrapeTimeout` capped every probe at a 4.5s deadline and raising a module timeout alone had no effect. Installations whose baseline latency is a large fraction of that deadline crossed it on endpoints that were still returning HTTP 200, making `probe_success` report latency rather than reachability.
- Point the `dns-tcp-internal` and `dns-udp-internal` ServiceMonitors at the `dns_*_internal` modules. They referenced the `_external` modules, so both probed `www.prometheus.io` and in-cluster DNS resolution was never monitored.

### security-bundle [v2.3.0...v2.4.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/security-bundle/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0)

#### Added

- Add e2e scenarios covering trivy-operator `VulnerabilityReport` creation, starboard-exporter metrics for that report, kyverno restricted PSS enforcement, and kyverno-policy-operator `PolicyException` translation.

#### Changed

- Update `exception-recommender` (app) to v0.3.0.
- Update `falco` (app) to v0.13.0.
- Update `jiralert` (app) to v0.1.4.
- Update `kubescape` (app) to v0.1.1.
- Update `kyverno-policies` (app) to v0.27.1.
- Update `policy-api` (app) to v0.0.12.
- Update `starboard-exporter` (app) to v1.2.15.
- Update `trivy` (app) to v0.18.0.
- Update `trivy-operator` (app) to v0.15.0.

#### Removed

- Remove `gel` (app).

#### Fixed

- Give `kubescape` a 15m install and upgrade timeout. It does not finish installing within Flux's 5m default, so it failed with `context deadline exceeded` and then retried indefinitely.
- Set `createNamespace` on every app in the bundle, so each one creates its target namespace instead of relying on another app to have created it first. Previously `kubescape` failed with `namespaces "kubescape" not found`, and the apps targeting `security-bundle` could only install after `kyverno-policy-operator` had created it.

### teleport-kube-agent [v0.11.1...v0.12.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/teleport-kube-agent-app/compare/v0.11.1...v0.12.0)

#### Changed

- Updated `teleport-kube-agent` to upstream version `v18.10.7`.

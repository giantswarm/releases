## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 11.2.2 for KVM :zap:

**If you are upgrading from 11.2.1, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

The release includes reliability improvements to these pre-installed apps: NGINX Ingress Controller and kube-state-metrics.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.

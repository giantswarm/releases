## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 11.2.2 for KVM :zap:

**If you are upgrading from 11.2.1, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

The release includes reliability improvements to these pre-installed apps: NGINX Ingress Controller and kube-state-metrics.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.

### kube-state-metrics v1.9.5 ([Giant Swarm app v1.0.5](https://github.com/giantswarm/kube-state-metrics-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v105))

- Upgraded to kube-state-metrics [new release 1.9.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/releases/tag/v1.9.5).

### nginx-ingress-controller v0.30.0 ([Giant Swarm app v1.6.8](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v168-2020-04-09))

- Aligned graceful termination configuration with changes done in upstream [ingress-nginx 0.26.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/nginx-0.26.0)
  - Use `wait-shutdown` as preStop hook
  - Make `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` configurable
  - Set `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` by default to 5min, to align with 270 second default `worker-shutdown-timeout`.
- Default `max-worker-connections` to `0`, making it same as `max-worker-open-files` i.e. `max open files (system's limit) / worker-processes - 1024`.
  This optimizes for high load conditions where it improves performance at the cost of increasing RAM utilization (even on idle).
- HorizontalPodAutoscaler was tuned to use `targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage` of `80` due to increased RAM utilization with new default for `max-worker-connections` of `0`.
- Changed default `error-log-level` from `error` to `notice`.
- Removed use of `enable-dynamic-certificates` CLI flag, it has been deprecated since [ingress-nginx 0.26.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/Changelog.md#0260) via [ingress-nginx PR #4356](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/4356).
- Added a link to the README in the sources of Chart.yaml

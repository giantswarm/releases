# :zap: Giant Swarm Release 11.1.1 for AWS is now active for you! :zap:

## aws-operator 8.2.1

- Replaces Calico CNI (Container Network Interface) with [AWS CNI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s). This enables Pod to Pod networking throughout AWS regions. As a result of this change, CIDR (IPv4 address blocks) for tenant cluster Pods are changing. They now must adhere to the rules described in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html#add-cidr-block-restrictions).

## cluster-operator 2.1.5

- Fix CR deletion for Tenant Cluster certificate management.

## kiam (GS v1.2.1)

- Change name of the interfaces to manage for AWS CNI. See the [app changelog](https://github.com/giantswarm/kiam-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v121-2020-03-14) for details.

## coreDNS (GS v1.1.6)

- Add Pod Disruption Budget.
- Allow custom forward configuration destination and options.
- Add `autopath` variable in the values file to make possible to configure or disable the plugin.

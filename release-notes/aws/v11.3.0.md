## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 11.3.0 for AWS :zap:

This release includes Kubernetes v1.16.9 as well as reliability and user experience improvements.

In addition, this release replaces CoreOS with Flatcar Container Linux.
CoreOS has gone [end-of-life](https://coreos.com/os/eol/) and is being rapidly phased out.
Flatcar is a compatible fork of CoreOS which receives ongoing support.
To continue receiving security updates and to minimize the effort needed to migrate in the future, we recommend upgrading to this release.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.

# AWS v11.2.0

## aws-operator 8.2.2

- Replaces Calico CNI (Container Network Interface) with [AWS CNI](https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s) and enables Pod to Pod networking throughout AWS regions. As a result of this change, CIDR (IPv4 address blocks) for tenant cluster Pods are changing. They now must adhere to the rules described in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html#add-cidr-block-restrictions).

- The VPC peering from tenant cluster to control plane is now labeled and queried in a way that aws-operator will only act on this one, leaving customer-created peerings untouched. https://github.com/giantswarm/aws-operator/pull/2187

- The number of Persistent Volumes is now limited statically, currently to 20 per node. This mitigates a problem customers had, where Kubernetes would attempt to calculate the limit of volumes per node

- TODO: Reduce scope of IAM tenant cluster policy (Fer, aws-operator) (TODO Marian, Pau)

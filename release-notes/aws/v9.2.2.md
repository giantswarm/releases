## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 9.2.2 for AWS is now active for you! :zap:

**If you are upgrading from 9.2.1, upgrading to this release merely updates the apps. It will *not* roll your nodes.**

**It is not recommended to upgrade from 9.0.0 or older platform release, please only upgrade to 9.2.2 from 9.0.1 or newer once they are available.**

Rationale for this is that 9.0.0 and older platform releases include apps which are still using Kubernetes 1.16 incompatible APIs

This release includes multiple improvements to the NGINX Ingress Controller app.

This version also includes an upgrade to the latest upstream NGINX IC 0.30.0, as well as improvements to other components (cluster-operator, kube-state-metrics, chart-operator) as detailed in the changelog.

To upgrade, please contact your Solution Engineer.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.

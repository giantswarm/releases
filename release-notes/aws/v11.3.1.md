## :zap: Giant Swarm Release v11.3.1 for AWS :zap:

This release provides fixes for a race condition seen in some upgrades to v11.2.x when allocating the IP address for the master node.

In addition, we add support for disabling [external source network address translation (SNAT)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/external-snat.html) for pod IP addresses via the Control Plane Kubernetes API, plus we pick up some minor component updates.

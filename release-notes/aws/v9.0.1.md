## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 9.0.1 for AWS is now active for you! :zap:

This release includes Kubernetes v1.15.11 as well as some reliability and user experience improvements.
We highly recommend you to upgrade to this release if you want to continue running on Kubernetes 1.15 for now.
This is also the first release which is internally represented by our [Release CRD](https://docs.giantswarm.io/reference/cp-k8s-api/releases.release.giantswarm.io/). This is done in preparation of opening up the control plane to you.

This release includes multiple improvements to the NGINX Ingress Controller app:
1. It upgrades to upstream ingress-nginx `v0.30.0`.
2. Optional metrics Service for prometheus-operator support was added. This allows prometheus-operator to scrape metrics to monitor the app.
3. NGINX IC SSL support for old browsers and clients (e.g. Safari 9) is dropped. This is due to default SSL ciphers no longer including AES-CBC based ciphers since they are considered weak. At your own risk, weak ciphers can still be enabled on demand independently for each cluster.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.

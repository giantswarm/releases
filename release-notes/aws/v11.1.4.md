# :zap: Giant Swarm Release v11.1.4 for AWS :zap:

This release makes the pod CIDR of a tenant cluster configurable via the control plane Kubernetes API. When using this option to avoid IP address overlap, this enables VPC peering between tenant clusters of the same installation.

__Note:__ Upgrading to this release from any release prior v11.1.1 will cause a network downtime due to the network-related changes coming with the switch from Calico CNI to AWS CNI.

# :zap: Giant Swarm Release 10.1.0 for AWS is now active for you! :zap:

We are pleased to announce that the new Cluster API enabled release v10.1.0
contains the much anticipated Node Pools feature. Upcoming features expected to
be released next year will be High Availability of Masters and Spot Instances.

We want to kindly remind you that the Node Pools enabled releases imply a
breaking change. This means existing clusters below the 10.x.x major releases
are not upgradable. We will continue to support the 9.x.x releases with bug
fixes and security patches for the next 6 months. During that timeframe we want
to make sure you are able to move all your workloads to new clusters, which we
are glad to assist you with.

In the meantime, we hope you enjoy using Node Pools of which the documentation
can be found here: https://docs.giantswarm.io/basics/nodepools/ including the
other release changes which are listed below:

*NOTE:* With this release we are NOT rolling out NGINX Ingress Controller by
default anymore. It is now an optional App in the App Catalog and can be
installed and configured on demand. The new app includes all the [changes made
to the old one](https://github.com/giantswarm/kubernetes-nginx-ingress-controller/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
as well as more configuration options. You can follow further development

## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 10.1.0 for AWS is now active for you! :zap:

We are pleased to announce that the new Cluster API enabled release v10.1.0 contains the much anticipated Node Pools feature.

We want to remind you that the Node Pools enabled releases imply a breaking change. This means **existing clusters** below the 10.x.x major releases **are not upgradable**. 
We will continue to support the 9.x.x releases with bug fixes and security patches for the next 6 months. During that timeframe please **ensure you  move all your workloads to new clusters**. We are at your service to assist with this.

We hope you enjoy using Node Pools of which the documentation can be found here: https://docs.giantswarm.io/basics/nodepools/ including the other release changes which are listed below:

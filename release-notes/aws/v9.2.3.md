## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 9.2.3 for AWS :zap:

**If you are upgrading from 9.2.2, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

This release includes an important change to NGINX Ingress Controller termination configuration so that active connections get drained gracefully.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.

### nginx-ingress-controller v0.30.0 ([Giant Swarm app v1.6.7](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v167-2020-04-08))

- Align graceful termination configuration with changes done in upstream [ingress-nginx 0.26.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/nginx-0.26.0)
  - Use `wait-shutdown` as preStop hook
  - Make `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` configurable
  - Set `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` by default to 5min, to align with 270 second default `worker-shutdown-timeout`

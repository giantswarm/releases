## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 9.2.0 for AWS is now active for you! :zap:

This release upgrades the NGINX Ingress Controller app to upstream ingress-nginx v0.29.0. We also added optional metrics Service for prometheus-operator support. This allows prometheus-operator to scrape metrics to monitor the app.

Among multiple improvements, this upgrade comes with a **breaking change â€”**  default SSL ciphers no longer include AES-CBC based ciphers since they are considered weak. As a side effect, this drops SSL support for old browsers and clients which do not support AES-GCM ciphers (e.g. Safari 9). At your own risk, weak ciphers can still be enabled on demand independently for each cluster.

To ensure a smooth upgrade and migration experience, and for additional questions you may have in relation to these changes, as always, please consult with your Solution Engineer.

Please note: If you are upgrading from 9.1.0, upgrading to this release merely updates the app. It will **not** roll your nodes.

# :zap: Giant Swarm Release v9.0.5 for AWS :zap:

This release fixes a rare bug that would prevent the NGINX IC from being installed on a new cluster. 

This bug would only occur on cluster creation if you had a nginx-ingress-controller-user-values configmap in the kube-system namespace while the cluster was still initialising.

Solution Engineers have already done the manual fix for affected customers.

It also modifies release templates to support the coming upgrade to Helm 3.

# :zap: Giant Swarm Release v9.3.22for AWS :zap:

This release fixes an issue where upgrading from an earlier release would cause the `nginx-ingress-controller` service to have no endpoints.

Solution Engineers have already done the manual fix for affected customers.

## nginx-ingress-controller [GS v1.6.11](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/releases/tag/v1.6.11)

- Align labels, using `app.kubernetes.io/name` instead of `k8s-app` where possible. `k8s-app` remains to be used for compatibility reasons.
- Make NGINX IC Service `externalTrafficPolicy` configurable and default to `Local`.

# :zap: Giant Swarm Release v9.3.22 for AWS :zap:

This release fixes an issue where upgrading from an earlier platform release to platform release v9.3.0 or v9.3.1 would cause the `nginx-ingress-controller` service to have no endpoints.

Solution Engineers have already applied a manual fix to affected clusters (ones based on AWS 9.3.0 and 9.3.1 platform releases).

## nginx-ingress-controller v0.30.0 ([Giant Swarm app v1.6.11](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1611-2020-05-26))

- Align labels, using `app.kubernetes.io/name` instead of `k8s-app` where possible. `k8s-app` remains to be used for compatibility reasons.

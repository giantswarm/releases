## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 9.1.1 for AWS is now active for you! :zap:

This release upgrades the NGINX Ingress Controller app to upstream ingress-nginx v0.29.0. Among multiple improvements this upgrade comes with a **breaking change** - default SSL ciphers no longer include AES-CBC based ciphers since they are considered weak. As side-effect this also drops SSL support for old browsers and clients which do not support AES-GCM ciphers (e.g. Safari 9). At your own risk weak ciphers can still be enabled on demand independently for each cluster.

We also added optional metrics Service for prometheus-operator support. This allows prometheus-operator to scrape metrics to monitor the app.

To ensure smooth upgrade and migration experience, and for any additional questions you may have in relation to these changes, as always, please consult with your support engineer.

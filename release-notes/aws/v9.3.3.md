# :zap: Giant Swarm Release v9.3.3 for AWS :zap:

**If you are upgrading from 9.3.2, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

This release improves the reliability of NGINX Ingress Controller.

Specifically, liveness probe is configured to be more fault tolerant than readiness probe. This helps shed load when it goes beyond replica capacity, speeding up recovery when NGINX gets overloaded.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.

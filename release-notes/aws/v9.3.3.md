# :zap: Giant Swarm Release v9.3.3 for AWS :zap:

**If you are upgrading from 9.3.2, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

This release improves the reliability of NGINX Ingress Controller. Most importantly, liveness probe configuration has been adjusted to be more fault tollerant than readiness probe. This helps shed excess load when the load goes over the replica capacity.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.

### nginx-ingress-controller v0.30.0 ([Giant Swarm app v1.6.12](https://github.com/giantswarm/nginx-ingress-controller-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1612-2020-06-04))

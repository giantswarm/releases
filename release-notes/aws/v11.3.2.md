## :zap: Giant Swarm Release v11.3.2 for AWS :zap:

**If you are upgrading from 11.3.1, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

This release fixes an external-dns issue affecting clusters in AWS China. We added an option for the app to use CNAME records instead of ALIAS, in order for DNS resolution to work in China.

Note though that the fix works for new cluster creation only. For cluster upgrades, there is a known upstream external-dns issue: Existing ingress A+TXT record sets do not get replaced with CNAME+TXT record sets even when external-dns is configured with CNAMEs as preferred.

We're working with external-dns community to provide the automatic working solution for cluster upgrades too. Until then, if you're upgrading cluster from aws platform release in [11.0.1 - 11.3.1] range, a manual workaround has to be applied - make sure to delete ingress A+TXT record sets, external-dns will then automatically create CNAME+TXT record sets. It is recommended to delegate applying this workaround to your SEs.

## external-dns v0.5.18 ([Giant Swarm app v1.2.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v121-2020-05-29))

- Prefer CNAMEs record sets for AWS SDK configuration with explicit credentials.

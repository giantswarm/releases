## :zap: Giant Swarm Release v11.3.2 for AWS :zap:

**If you are upgrading from 11.3.1, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

This release fixes an external-dns issue affecting clusters in AWS China. We added an option for the app to use CNAME records instead of ALIAS, in order for DNS resolution to work in China.

## external-dns v0.5.18 ([Giant Swarm app v1.2.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v121-2020-05-29))

- Prefer CNAMEs record sets for AWS SDK configuration with explicit credentials.

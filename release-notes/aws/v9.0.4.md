# :zap: Giant Swarm Release 9.0.4 for AWS :zap:

**Note** If you are upgrading from 8.5.0 or 9.0.0: The `nginx-ingress-controller-user-values` configmap has been migrated from the `kube-system` namespace of your Tenant Cluster to a namespace on the Control Plane.

If you had a cluster with id `e05c8`, then you'll find your `nginx-ingress-controller-user-values`
configmap now in a namespace called `e05c8` on the Control Plane.

If you do not yet have access to the Control Plane API you will not be able to manually configure your ingress anymore. Please contact your Solution Engineer for more information.

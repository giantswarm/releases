## ⚡️ Giant Swarm Release 11.2.2 for Azure ⚡️

This release contains improvements in the upgrade procedure.
We have improved new nodes discovery at the stage where the cluster size is doubled with new versions of the machines.
This will make sure that in case of upgrade disruptions, the process will follow its original path.

The release also includes couple of reliability improvements to pre-installed apps such as NGINX Ingress Controller and kube-state-metrics.

To upgrade, please contact your Solution Engineer.

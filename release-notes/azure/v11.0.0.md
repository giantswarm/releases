## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 11.0.0 for Azure is now active for you! :zap:

This is the first Giant Swarm release including Kubernetes 1.16. As part of this release, we have also removed CPU limits from several supporting components and adjusted priority classes to ensure system reliability under heavy load. More details about changes to individual components can be found below.

**Note**: This release includes a [network policy](https://docs.giantswarm.io/guides/limiting-pod-communication-with-network-policies/#default-policies) which blocks traffic to and from pods in the `giantswarm` and `kube-system` namespaces to improve security. GS components have been modified to work under this environment, but any other workload pods in these namespaces may cease to function without a network policy allowing ingress and egress.

**Note**: As previously communicated, Kubernetes 1.16 has removed several API groups which were already deprecated. Please ensure that all affected components have been updated to the 1.16 compatible versions before upgrading clusters from 1.15.

---

### azure-operator v2.8.0
- Fixed automatic reconciliation of failed deployments.
- Added checksum calculation to avoid applying the same VMSS template over and over again.
- Fixed the systemd unit that mounts the Docker volume on worker nodes.
- Added a new volume for the kubelet directory on worker nodes.
- Hardened 'restricted' PodSecurityPolicy (added UID range).

### Calico v3.10.1
- Updated from v3.9.1 - [changelog](https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.10/release-notes/)
- Calico now supports two new top-level selectors to make writing Calico network policy easier. The `namespaceSelector` allows you to select the namespace(s) to apply a global network policy to. This enables you to write a single network policy applicable to one or more namespaces.
- Calico now supports BGP advertisement of Kubernetes service ExternalIPs in addition to advertising ClusterIPs. Advertising service external IPs allows for more flexible routing architectures.
- Configurable default IPv4, IPv6 block sizes and pool node selectors.
- Typha is now run as a non-root user for improved security.

- Updated from upstream `coredns` v1.6.4 - [changelog](https://coredns.io/2019/11/05/coredns-1.6.5-release/)
- Removed CPU limits.
- Migrated to be deployed via an app CR not a chartconfig CR.

### CoreOS Container Linux v2247.6.0
- Updated from v2191.5.0 - [changelog](https://coreos.com/releases/#2247.6.0)
- Updated Linux kernel to 4.19.78.

### etcd v3.3.17
- Updated from v3.3.15 - [changelog](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/CHANGELOG-3.3.md#v3317-2019-10-11)

### external-dns v0.5.11 ([GS v1.1.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/external-dns-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v110))
- Removed CPU limits.

### Helm v2.16.1 (primarily for GS-internal use)
- Updated from v2.14.3 - [changelog](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v2.16.1)
- Helm v2.15 was the last feature release for Helm v2 as new feature development now happens in Helm v3. The v2.16 release include fixes to issues that are too large of a change for a patch release.

### kiam v3.4.0 ([GS v1.0.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/kiam-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v102-2020-01-04))
- Removed CPU limits.

### Kubernetes v1.16.3
- Updated from v1.15.5 - [changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.16.md#kubernetes-v1160-release-notes)
- **Custom resources**: CRDs are in widespread use as a way to extend Kubernetes to persist and serve new resource types, and have been available in beta since the 1.7 release. The 1.16 release marks the graduation of CRDs to general availability (GA).
- **Admission webhooks**: Admission webhooks are in widespread use as a Kubernetes extensibility mechanism and have been available in beta since the 1.9 release. The 1.16 release marks the graduation of admission webhooks to general availability (GA).
- **Overhauled metrics**: Kubernetes has previously made extensive use of a global metrics registry to register metrics to be exposed. By implementing a metrics registry, metrics are registered in more transparent means. Previously, Kubernetes metrics have been excluded from any kind of stability requirements.
- **Volume Extension**: There are quite a few enhancements in this release that pertain to volumes and volume modifications. Volume resizing support in CSI specs is moving to beta which allows for any CSI spec volume plugin to be resizable.
- **Node labels** beta.kubernetes.io/metadata-proxy-ready, beta.kubernetes.io/metadata-proxy-ready and beta.kubernetes.io/kube-proxy-ds-ready are no longer added on new nodes.
- **Network Policies**: Giantswarm added a `deny-all` network policy by default. This policy is applied to all pods in sensitive namespaces such as `giantswarm` or `kube-system`. To communicate with any pods in these namespaces you need to explicitly create a Network Policy that allows it.
- As previously communicated, resources under `apps/v1beta1` and `apps/v1beta2` groups have been moved to `apps/v1` instead. Similarly, `daemonsets`, `deployments`, `replicasets` resources under `extensions/v1beta1` have been moved to `apps/v1`, `networkpolicies` under `extensions/v1beta1` to `networking.k8s.io/v1`, and `podsecuritypolicies` under `extensions/v1beta1` to `policy/v1beta1`.

### kube-state-metrics v1.9.2 ([GS v1.0.2](https://github.com/giantswarm/kube-state-metrics-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v102))
- Updated to upstream version 1.9.2 - [changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v192--2020-01-13).
- Adjusted RBAC configuration.

### net-exporter [v1.5.1](https://github.com/giantswarm/net-exporter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#151-2020-01-08)
- Changed priority class to `system-node-critical`.

### node_exporter v0.18.1 ([GS v1.2.0](https://github.com/giantswarm/node-exporter-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#120-2020-01-08))
- Updated to upstream version 0.18.1 - [changelog](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0181--2019-06-04).

## :zap:  Giant Swarm Release 11.3.0 for Azure :zap:

This release replaces CoreOS Container Linux that is going [end of life](https://coreos.com/os/eol/) on 26th of May 2020 with Flatcar Container Linux. 

Migration process requires replacing VMSS CoreOS image with Flatcar image which, due to Azure limitations, is not possible. In order to enable existing clusters to upgrade with this release we had to amend standard procedure with additional steps that replace old VMSS with a new one, ensuring all workload is moved. 

### Warning
Due to additional steps in upgrade process, the whole procedure will take more time, up to a few hours. It also requires manual steps on our side, so please **schedule all upgrades with your SE at least one day in advance**. This will allow us to prepare and guarantee appropriate support throughout the upgrade process.

Initial tests shown up to 2% loss of incoming traffic over the time period of 5-10min. It was not confirmed in the following tests but because of the complexity of the process you should be aware that this may occur.

## ⚡️ Giant Swarm Release 11.2.5 for Azure ⚡️

**If you are upgrading from 11.2.4, upgrading to this release will not roll your nodes. It will only update the apps.**

This release improves the reliability of NGINX Ingress Controller. Most importantly, kernel and app settings have been tuned to increase out-of-the-box performance. The app's Helm chart was also adjusted to improve its availability when rolling out configuration changes.

Below, you can find more details on components that were changed with this release.

## :zap: Giant Swarm Release 8.6.0 for Azure is now active for you! :zap:

Includes an important rate limiting fix for VMSS (also included in release 9.0.0 with Kubernetes 1.15.5).

### Kubernetes v1.14.9
- Updated from v1.14.6 - [changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.14.md#v1149)
- Several improvements to metrics and apiserver performance.
- Fixes aggressive VM calls for Azure VMSS [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83102).
- Fixes a flaw ([CVE-2019-11253](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11253)) in json/yaml decoding where large or malformed documents could consume excessive server resources. Request bodies for normal API requests (create/delete/update/patch operations of regular resources) are now limited to 3MB.

### CoreOS Container Linux v2135.6.0
- Updated from v2135.4.0 for improved regional availability - [changelog](https://coreos.com/releases/#2135.6.0)
- Increased `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` to 8192 (from default of 128) to mitigate issues with too many open files on nodes with many pods.
